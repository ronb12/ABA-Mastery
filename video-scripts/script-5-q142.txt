VIDEO SCRIPT: DRL Implementation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering DRL Implementation - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:
A BCBA implements a DRL (Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates) procedure for a student who talks out during class. The student currently talks out 20 times per hour. Which schedule would be MOST appropriate to start?"

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]
"Your options are:
A. Reinforce if talking out occurs 0 times per hour
B. Reinforce if talking out occurs 5 or fewer times per hour
C. Reinforce if talking out occurs 18 or fewer times per hour
D. Reinforce if talking out occurs 30 or fewer times per hour"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is C: Reinforce if talking out occurs 18 or fewer times per hour"

[SLIDE 5 - DETAILED EXPLANATION]
"Let me explain why this is correct:

DRL should start with a criterion only slightly below current baseline (e.g., 10-20% reduction). Starting at 18/hour from 20/hour allows initial success and reinforcement. Too drastic a reduction (like 5/hour or 0/hour) would result in no reinforcement and treatment failure. The criterion is gradually tightened as progress occurs."

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- Reinforce if talking out occurs 0 times per hour: This is incorrect because...
- Reinforce if talking out occurs 5 or fewer times per hour: This is incorrect because...
- Reinforce if talking out occurs 30 or fewer times per hour: This is incorrect because..."

[SLIDE 7 - KEY TAKEAWAY]
"The key takeaway: Remember this distinction, and you'll be able to answer any exam question on this topic."
