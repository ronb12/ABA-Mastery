VIDEO SCRIPT: IOA Calculation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering IOA Calculation - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:
IOA (Interobserver Agreement) is calculated for what primary reason?"

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]
"Your options are:
A. To determine if behavior change is clinically significant
B. To assess measurement reliability and observer accuracy
C. To identify the function of behavior
D. To calculate effect size"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is B: To assess measurement reliability and observer accuracy"

[SLIDE 5 - DETAILED EXPLANATION]
"Let me explain why this is correct:

IOA assesses MEASUREMENT RELIABILITY - the degree to which two independent observers record the same values. High IOA (typically ≥80%) indicates measurement system is reliable and data are trustworthy. Low IOA suggests unclear operational definitions, inadequate observer training, or measurement system problems. IOA doesn't measure clinical significance, function, or effect size."

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- To determine if behavior change is clinically significant: This is incorrect because...
- To identify the function of behavior: This is incorrect because...
- To calculate effect size: This is incorrect because..."

[SLIDE 7 - KEY TAKEAWAY]
"The key takeaway: Remember this distinction, and you'll be able to answer any exam question on this topic."
