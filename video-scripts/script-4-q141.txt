VIDEO SCRIPT: Differential Reinforcement (DRO)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering Differential Reinforcement (DRO) - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:
In a DRO (Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior) procedure, reinforcement is delivered:"

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]
"Your options are:
A. For any behavior except the target problem behavior
B. Only for a specific alternative behavior
C. When the problem behavior has NOT occurred for a specified interval
D. Immediately following the problem behavior"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is C: When the problem behavior has NOT occurred for a specified interval"

[SLIDE 5 - DETAILED EXPLANATION]
"Let me explain why this is correct:

DRO delivers reinforcement contingent on the ABSENCE of the problem behavior for a specified time period. If the problem behavior occurs during the interval, the timer resets. This is different from DRA (reinforcing a specific alternative) or DRI (reinforcing incompatible behavior). DRO is often used when a specific replacement behavior hasn't been identified."

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- For any behavior except the target problem behavior: This is incorrect because...
- Only for a specific alternative behavior: This is incorrect because...
- Immediately following the problem behavior: This is incorrect because..."

[SLIDE 7 - KEY TAKEAWAY]
"The key takeaway: Remember this distinction, and you'll be able to answer any exam question on this topic."
