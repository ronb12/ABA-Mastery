VIDEO SCRIPT: Verbal Operants - Tact
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering Verbal Operants - Tact - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:
You observe a colleague implementing an intervention with a client that is not in the written treatment plan and appears potentially harmful. What is your FIRST step?"

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]
"Your options are:
A. Report directly to the BACB immediately
B. Discuss your concerns directly with the colleague
C. Document everything and do nothing else
D. Tell the client's family about your concerns"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is B: Discuss your concerns directly with the colleague"

[SLIDE 5 - DETAILED EXPLANATION]
"Let me explain why this is correct:

Per BACB Code 7.02, attempt to resolve conflicts INFORMALLY first by discussing directly with the colleague. They may have a valid explanation, or you may be able to redirect them. If issue isn't resolved or if there's imminent danger, THEN escalate through proper channels. Going directly to BACB or family before attempting informal resolution violates the Code's conflict resolution hierarchy."

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- Report directly to the BACB immediately: This is incorrect because...
- Document everything and do nothing else: This is incorrect because...
- Tell the client's family about your concerns: This is incorrect because..."

[SLIDE 7 - KEY TAKEAWAY]
"The key takeaway: Remember this distinction, and you'll be able to answer any exam question on this topic."
