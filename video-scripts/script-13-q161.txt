[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering Establishing Operations - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:
Establishing operations (EOs) have which two effects on behavior?"

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]
"Your options are:
A. Increase value of reinforcer; increase behavior
B. Momentary effectiveness (value-altering) and evocative/abative (behavior-altering)
C. Short-term and long-term behavior change
D. Automatic and social reinforcement"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is B: Momentary effectiveness (value-altering) and evocative/abative (behavior-altering)"

[SLIDE 5 - DETAILED EXPLANATION]
"Let me explain why this is correct:

EOs have TWO functions: (1) VALUE-ALTERING effect - temporarily increases/decreases reinforcer effectiveness, and (2) BEHAVIOR-ALTERING effect - increases/decreases behavior that has produced that reinforcer (evocative or abative). Example: Food deprivation (EO) increases value of food AND increases food-seeking behavior. Both effects work together to influence behavior."

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- Increase value of reinforcer; increase behavior: This is incorrect because...
- Short-term and long-term behavior change: This is incorrect because...
- Automatic and social reinforcement: This is incorrect because..."
