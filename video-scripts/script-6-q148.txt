[SLIDE 1 - TITLE]
"Hi everyone! Today we're covering Functional Behavior Assessment - an important concept for the BCBA and BCaBA certification exams."

[SLIDE 2 - THE QUESTION]
"Let's start with a sample exam question:

[SLIDE 3 - ANSWER OPTIONS]

B. To identify the function (purpose) of problem behavior
C. To determine if punishment is needed
D. To measure baseline frequency of behavior"

[SLIDE 4 - CORRECT ANSWER]
"The correct answer is B: To identify the function (purpose) of problem behavior"

[SLIDE 6 - COMMON MISTAKES]
"Here's why the other options are incorrect:
- To diagnose psychological disorders: This is incorrect because...
- To determine if punishment is needed: This is incorrect because...
- To measure baseline frequency of behavior: This is incorrect because..."
