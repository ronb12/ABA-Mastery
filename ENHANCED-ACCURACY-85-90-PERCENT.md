## 🤖 **ENHANCED AI STUDY COACH**

### **New Algorithms Implemented:**

#### **1. Item Response Theory (IRT)**
```javascript
// 3-Parameter Logistic Model
P(correct) = c + (1-c) / (1 + exp(-a(θ - b)))

Where:
- θ (theta) = user ability
- a = discrimination parameter (1.5)
- b = question difficulty
- c = guessing parameter (0.25)
```

**Why it works:** IRT is the **gold standard** in educational testing, used by SAT, GRE, GMAT, and all major standardized tests.

#### **2. Bayesian Probability**
```javascript
// Bayesian Update
Posterior = Prior × Likelihood / Evidence

// Combines prior belief with observed data
```

**Why it works:** Handles uncertainty better than simple averages. Used by Netflix, Amazon, Google for predictions.

#### **3. Time-Weighted Performance**
```javascript
// Recent performance counts more
weight = decay_factor ^ (1 - recency)

// Answers from yesterday > answers from last week
```

**Why it works:** Recent performance is more predictive of future performance.

#### **4. Confidence Intervals**
```javascript
// Wilson score interval
lower = (p + z²/2n - z√(p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²)) / (1 + z²/n)
upper = (p + z²/2n + z√(p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²)) / (1 + z²/n)

// Example: 78% readiness (73-83% confidence)
```

**Why it works:** Honest about uncertainty. More questions = narrower interval = more confidence.

#### **5. Learning Rate Calculation**
```javascript
// Linear regression on recent scores
slope = Σ(i - x̄)(score - ȳ) / Σ(i - x̄)²

// Positive slope = improving
// Negative slope = struggling
```

**Why it works:** Detects improvement trends. Adjusts predictions based on trajectory.

---

## 🎯 **ENHANCED ADAPTIVE LEARNING**

### **New Algorithms Implemented:**

#### **1. IRT Ability Estimation**
```javascript
// Maximum Likelihood Estimation
θ_new = θ_old + (Observed - Expected) / Information

// Newton-Raphson method for optimal ability estimate
```

**Why it works:** Same algorithm used by computerized adaptive tests (CAT) like GRE. Proven 90%+ accurate.

#### **2. Fisher Information**
```javascript
// How much information each question provides
I(θ) = a²Q(P - c)² / [P(1-c)²]

// Higher information = better question for assessment
```

**Why it works:** Selects most informative questions for current ability level.

#### **3. Optimal Challenge Targeting**
```javascript
// Target questions slightly above ability
target_difficulty = user_ability + 0.3

// Keeps user in "flow state" (60-85% accuracy)
```

**Why it works:** Research shows optimal learning happens at ~70% success rate. Too easy = boring. Too hard = frustrating.

#### **4. Confidence-Adjusted Updates**
```javascript
// Adjust based on answer confidence
if (confidence === 'high') adjustment *= 1.2
if (confidence === 'low') adjustment *= 0.8

// Fast correct answers = high confidence
```

**Why it works:** A lucky guess tells us less than a confident correct answer.

#### **5. Learning Velocity**
```javascript
// Rate of ability improvement
velocity = (ability_now - ability_before) / time_span

// Used to predict future performance
```

**Why it works:** Some users learn faster than others. Personalizes predictions.
