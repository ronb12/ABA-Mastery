## ‚è±Ô∏è **ESTIMATED TIMELINE**

**Creating Content:**
- 100 scenarios: 20-30 hours of writing
- 95 case studies: 30-40 hours of research/writing
- UI development: 10-15 hours

**Total:** 60-85 hours of focused work

## üöÄ **STRATEGY**

Since this is extensive, I'll create in **batches** and you can add progressively:

**Week 1:** 25 scenarios + UI foundation  
**Week 2:** 25 scenarios + 25 case studies  
**Week 3:** 25 scenarios + 25 case studies  
**Week 4:** 25 scenarios + 25 case studies + complete UI  

**OR** I can generate them faster using structured templates based on real ABA principles.
