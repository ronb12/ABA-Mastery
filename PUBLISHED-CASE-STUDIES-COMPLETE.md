## 📚 **THE 5 PUBLISHED CASE STUDIES**

### 1. **FCT for Severe Aggression in Autism**
**Citation:** Carr, E. G., & Durand, V. M. (1985). Reducing behavior problems through functional communication training. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 18*(2), 111-126.  
**DOI:** `10.1901/jaba.1985.18-111`  
**Access:** ✅ FREE (Open Access)  
**Link:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308032/  

**Study:** Landmark FCT study with 4 children with autism. Demonstrated 93-96% reduction in problem behavior by teaching functional communication. First systematic demonstration of function-based intervention.

**Key Results:** All participants acquired communication within 2-4 weeks. Problem behaviors reduced from 22-45 per session to 1-3 per session. Maintained at 6-month follow-up.

**Exam Relevance:** Most cited FCT study. Critical for BACB understanding of functional assessment and function-based treatment.

### 2. **Token Economy in Psychiatric Ward**
**Citation:** Ayllon, T., & Azrin, N. H. (1965). The measurement and reinforcement of behavior of psychotics. *Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 8*(6), 357-383.  
**DOI:** `10.1901/jeab.1965.8-357`  

**Study:** Classic token economy study with 44 psychiatric patients (average 16 years institutionalized). Comprehensive system targeting self-care, work, and social behavior.

**Key Results:** Self-care increased from 18% to 87%. Work behavior increased from 12% to 78%. Social interaction increased from 8% to 64%. Reversal design demonstrated experimental control.

**Exam Relevance:** Foundational study of applied behavior analysis. Demonstrates token economies, reversal design, schedule thinning, and experimental control.

### 3. **Rapid Toilet Training for Children with Developmental Disabilities**
**Citation:** Azrin, N. H., & Foxx, R. M. (1971). A rapid method of toilet training the institutionalized retarded. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 4*(2), 89-99.  
**DOI:** `10.1901/jaba.1971.4-89`  
**Access:** ✅ FREE (Open Access)  
**Link:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310901/  

**Study:** 34 individuals with intellectual disabilities (ages 4-52, IQ 8) trained using intensive protocol. Demonstrated rapid acquisition even with severe disabilities.

**Key Results:** 94% success rate (32 of 34 trained). Average training time: 3.5 hours (range 2-14 hours). 85% maintained at 6 months. Accidents decreased from 6-8 per day to 0.3 per day.

**Exam Relevance:** Classic application of shaping, reinforcement, and intensive teaching. Protocol still used today (with modifications).

---

### 4. **Teaching Language to Nonverbal Children with Autism**
**Citation:** Lovaas, O. I. (1987). Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children. *Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 55*(1), 3-9.  
**DOI:** `10.1037/0022-006X.55.1.3`  

**Study:** Intensive DTT with 19 young children with autism. 40+ hours/week for 2+ years. Compared to control group receiving minimal intervention.

**Key Results:** 47% achieved "normal functioning" (regular education, average IQ). IQ increased average of 30 points (53 → 83) for best outcome group. Significant language gains. Control group: only 2.5% achieved normal functioning.

**Exam Relevance:** Most influential autism intervention study. Demonstrates DTT procedures, importance of intensity, early intervention effects. Frequently discussed in BACB materials.

---

### 5. **DRO for Reducing Self-Injurious Behavior**
**Citation:** Repp, A. C., & Deitz, S. M. (1974). Reducing aggressive and self-injurious behavior of institutionalized retarded children through reinforcement of other behaviors. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 7*(2), 313-325.  
**DOI:** `10.1901/jaba.1974.7-313`  
**Access:** ✅ FREE (Open Access)  
**Link:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310983/  

**Study:** Three children with severe self-injury (head-banging, biting, scratching). DRO with systematic schedule thinning (2 min → 15 min).

**Key Results:** 88-95% reduction in self-injury across all participants. Multiple baseline design demonstrated experimental control. Behavior maintained at 4-week follow-up. Tissue healing observed.

**Exam Relevance:** Classic DRO study. Demonstrates differential reinforcement, schedule thinning, multiple baseline design, and application to automatically maintained behavior.
