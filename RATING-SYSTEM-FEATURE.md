# ⭐ In-App Rating System - DEPLOYED!

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **LIVE & ACTIVE**  
**Feature:** 5-Star Rating with Feedback

---

## 🎯 **WHAT IT IS**

A beautiful, non-intrusive 5-star rating system that:
- ✅ Prompts users at optimal moments
- ✅ Collects ratings and feedback
- ✅ Displays aggregate ratings to build social proof
- ✅ Saves to Firebase (with Firestore rules ready)
- ✅ Works for both authenticated and guest users

---

## ⭐ **HOW IT WORKS**

### **When Users See the Prompt:**

The rating prompt appears automatically when ANY of these conditions are met:
1. **After 50 questions answered** - User has experienced enough content
2. **After 2 hours of study time** - Engaged user
3. **After 7-day streak** - Committed user
4. **After reaching Level 5** - Active user

**Smart Timing:**
- ✅ Only shows once per user
- ✅ Waits 5 seconds after page load (not intrusive)
- ✅ If dismissed, waits 7 days before asking again
- ✅ Never interrupts active study

---
