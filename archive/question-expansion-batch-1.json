      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "B.F. Skinner (1938) founded radical behaviorism, which states that all behavior, including private events (thoughts and feelings), can be explained through environmental variables. Unlike methodological behaviorism (Watson), radical behaviorism acknowledges private events but explains them behaviorally rather than mentalistically.",

        "Biological, psychological, and environmental",
        "Natural, artificial, and automatic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skinner's selectionism proposes three levels: (1) Phylogenic - genetic/evolutionary selection (species survival), (2) Ontogenic - selection through individual's lifetime (operant conditioning), and (3) Cultural - selection of practices by groups (cultural evolution). This parallels Darwin's natural selection.",

        "Respondent is learned; operant is innate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Respondent (reflexive) behavior is ELICITED by antecedent stimuli automatically (e.g., pupil dilation to light). Operant (voluntary) behavior is EMITTED and selected/maintained by consequences (reinforcement/punishment). Both can be conditioned, but through different processes (classical vs. operant conditioning).",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The three branches are: (1) Behaviorism - the philosophy of the science, (2) Experimental Analysis of Behavior (EAB) - basic laboratory research discovering principles, and (3) Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) - application of principles to socially important problems. All three are interconnected.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Determinism is the philosophical assumption that all behavior is lawful and determined by functional relations with environmental events. The universe is orderly and events occur because of other events. This doesn't mean behavior is easily predictable, but that it follows natural laws and can be influenced systematically.",

        "Immediately following the problem behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "DRO delivers reinforcement contingent on the ABSENCE of the problem behavior for a specified time period. If the problem behavior occurs during the interval, the timer resets. This is different from DRA (reinforcing a specific alternative) or DRI (reinforcing incompatible behavior). DRO is often used when a specific replacement behavior hasn't been identified.",

        "Reinforce if talking out occurs 30 or fewer times per hour"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "DRL should start with a criterion only slightly below current baseline (e.g., 10-20% reduction). Starting at 18/hour from 20/hour allows initial success and reinforcement. Too drastic a reduction (like 5/hour or 0/hour) would result in no reinforcement and treatment failure. The criterion is gradually tightened as progress occurs.",

        "DRL (Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "DRI specifically reinforces behavior that CANNOT occur at the same time as the problem behavior (physically incompatible). Example: reinforcing hands in lap (incompatible with face-slapping). DRA reinforces any appropriate alternative but doesn't require incompatibility. DRI is often more effective because the replacement behavior prevents the problem behavior.",

        "Interresponse time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "DURATION measures how long a behavior lasts from start to finish. This is ideal for tantrums because the length/duration is the socially significant aspect. Frequency counts occurrences, latency measures delay until behavior starts, and IRT measures time between responses. Each dimension matches different behavioral concerns.",

        "Interresponse time (IRT)",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "LATENCY is the time between the onset of a stimulus (SD) and the initiation of the response. This is critical for compliance and following instructions. Duration would measure how long the response lasts. IRT measures time between consecutive responses (no SD involved). Latency helps evaluate prompt control and fluency.",

        "Whole interval recording",
        "Momentary time sampling",
        "Duration recording"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "MOMENTARY TIME SAMPLING is most practical for high-rate behaviors occurring throughout the day. Observer records if behavior is occurring at specific moments (e.g., every 2 minutes). This provides an estimate of prevalence without requiring continuous observation. Event recording would be too burdensome for 100+ responses/hour. Whole interval would underestimate high-rate behavior.",

        "They cannot be used for reliability assessment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "PERMANENT PRODUCTS are tangible items or effects produced by behavior that persist after behavior ends (e.g., completed worksheets, dishes washed, items assembled). Major advantage: can be measured at ANY time after occurrence without direct observation of behavior. Excellent for IOA (two observers can score the same product).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The PRIMARY purpose of FBA is identifying the FUNCTION (maintaining consequence) of problem behavior - typically attention, escape, tangible access, or automatic reinforcement. Understanding function guides intervention selection. FBA doesn't diagnose disorders, doesn't assume punishment is needed, and while baseline is measured, that's not the primary purpose.",

        "Functional analysis (FA)",
        "Scatter plot analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS (FA) is experimental manipulation - systematically presenting and removing antecedents/consequences while measuring behavior to demonstrate functional control. This is the 'gold standard' for identifying function. Indirect (interviews) and descriptive (ABC) methods suggest hypotheses but don't demonstrate experimental control. FA provides the strongest evidence of function.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "High rates ONLY in the alone condition (no social interaction, no demands, no tangibles) indicates AUTOMATIC (sensory) reinforcement. The behavior produces its own reinforcement through sensory stimulation. If behavior were maintained by attention, escape, or tangibles, it would be HIGH in those respective test conditions, not the alone condition.",

      "explanation": "Per BACB Code 7.02, attempt to resolve conflicts INFORMALLY first by discussing directly with the colleague. They may have a valid explanation, or you may be able to redirect them. If issue isn't resolved or if there's imminent danger, THEN escalate through proper channels.

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ethics Code 1.06 states behavior analysts avoid multiple relationships that could impair objectivity or risk exploitation. Providing services to a close friend's child creates dual relationships (professional + personal) that could impair judgment. Supervising RBTs, collaborating with teachers, and consulting with BCBAs are appropriate professional relationships without the conflict.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "TACT is labeling/naming controlled by a nonverbal discriminative stimulus (the physical cookie). The response is maintained by generalized social reinforcement ('Good talking!'). MAND would be requesting the cookie ('cookie please'). ECHOIC would be repeating someone saying 'cookie.'

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "MANDS are unique because they directly benefit the SPEAKER through SPECIFIC reinforcement (get what you request). Other operants produce generalized social reinforcement that doesn't specifically relate to the response form. Mands can be vocal or nonvocal (signs, pictures). This direct benefit makes mands highly functional and often easiest to teach first.",

The child isn't seeing a fire truck (not a tact), isn't repeating 'red' (not echoic), and isn't requesting red (not mand). The verbal stimulus 'What color is fire truck?' evokes 'red.'

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "ERROR CORRECTION in DTT typically involves neutral feedback ('let's try again'), optional prompt to correct response, then moving to next trial WITHOUT reinforcement for the prompted correct response. This prevents reinforcing errors while maintaining learning momentum. Time-out and reprimands are punishers (too harsh for learning trials). Simple extinction might not teach the correct response.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "MOST-TO-LEAST prompting starts with maximum assistance (full physical or full model) and gradually fades to less intrusive prompts as learner shows competence (partial physical → gestural → verbal → independent). This minimizes errors. LEAST-TO-MOST does opposite (starts independent, adds prompts if needed - allows more errors but promotes independence). Graduated guidance adjusts dynamically.

      "explanation": "BACKWARD CHAINING teaches the LAST step first. Instructor completes all steps except the final one, learner completes final step and gets natural reinforcement (task completion). Then teach second-to-last step, etc., working backward. Advantage: learner always experiences task completion/natural reinforcement. FORWARD chaining teaches first step first, working forward.",

        "Unconditioned EOs affect motivation; conditioned EOs do not",
        "Unconditioned EOs are temporary; conditioned EOs are permanent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "UNCONDITIONED EOs (UEOs) are unlearned motivating operations with phylogenic origins - all humans respond similarly (food deprivation, sleep deprivation, temperature). CONDITIONED EOs (CEOs) are learned through individual's experience - different for each person (studying → taking test; accumulating trash → taking out garbage). CEOs develop when neutral stimuli acquire EO properties through learning.",

        "The same speed regardless of prior schedule",
        "Faster, but with larger extinction burst"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Continuous reinforcement (CRF) produces FASTER extinction with SMALLER burst because the change is immediately obvious ('it always worked, now it never works'). Intermittent reinforcement creates greater RESISTANCE to extinction with potentially larger bursts because inconsistent reinforcement was already the norm ('sometimes it works, keep trying'). This is the partial reinforcement effect.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "NCR delivers the maintaining reinforcer on a FIXED-TIME (FT) or VARIABLE-TIME (VT) schedule REGARDLESS of behavior. This is an abolishing operation - providing 'free' access to reinforcer reduces its value, reducing motivation for problem behavior. Not truly random - schedule is systematic. NCR is effective for attention-maintained and tangible-maintained behaviors.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "IOA assesses MEASUREMENT RELIABILITY - the degree to which two independent observers record the same values. High IOA (typically ≥80%) indicates measurement system is reliable and data are trustworthy. Low IOA suggests unclear operational definitions, inadequate observer training, or measurement system problems. IOA doesn't measure clinical significance, function, or effect size.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "INTERVAL-BY-INTERVAL (exact agreement) is most conservative - only counts intervals where both observers recorded EXACTLY the same thing (both scored or both didn't score). Total count and mean count-per-interval can show high agreement even when observers disagree on which specific intervals. Scored-interval only considers intervals where at least one observer scored, inflating agreement. Interval-by-interval is recommended standard.",
