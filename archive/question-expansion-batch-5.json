      "question": "A fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule delivers reinforcement:",
      "options": [
        "After every 5th response",
        "After an average of 5 responses",
        "After 5 seconds",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "FIXED RATIO (FR) schedules deliver reinforcement after a FIXED number of responses. FR5 = reinforcement after exactly every 5th response (5, 10, 15, 20...). Produces high, steady rates with post-reinforcement pause. VARIABLE ratio would be average of 5. Interval schedules are time-based, not response-based. FR schedules are common in piecework, sales commissions, frequent flyer miles.",
