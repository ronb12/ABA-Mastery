        "Functional analysis (experimental)",
        "Skills assessment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ABC continuous recording is DESCRIPTIVE ASSESSMENT - direct observation of behavior in natural environment without manipulation. Observer records antecedents, behaviors, and consequences as they occur. This generates hypotheses about function but doesn't demonstrate experimental control (that's functional analysis). More objective than indirect assessments (interviews, checklists).",

        "Previous interventions have failed",
        "The behavior occurs at moderate frequency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "SEVERE/DANGEROUS behaviors may contraindicate FA because FA deliberately evokes problem behavior through test conditions. If behavior causes significant harm, risks may outweigh benefits. Consider: brief FA, latency-based FA, trial-based FA, or precursor FA instead. Having multiple caregivers, previous failures, and moderate frequency are actually GOOD conditions for conducting FA.",

      "explanation": "DEMAND (escape) condition presents tasks/demands and removes them contingent on problem behavior, testing if behavior is maintained by NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT (escape/avoidance). High rates in demand condition suggest escape function. Attention condition tests positive reinforcement (attention), tangible tests access to items, alone/no interaction tests automatic reinforcement.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ethics Code 2.15 requires recommending LEAST RESTRICTIVE, scientifically supported procedures. Educate about alternatives, risks/benefits. Try reinforcement-based approaches first. If parent still insists on restrictive approach without clinical justification, you may need to decline services.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "RESPONSE COST is negative punishment (Type II punishment) - REMOVING specific amounts of reinforcer contingent on problem behavior. Must have reinforcers to remove (token economy, privileges, points). Example: Lose 5 tokens for swearing. Different from positive punishment (adding aversive). Different from time-out (removing access to all reinforcement). Effectiveness depends on sufficient reinforcers remaining.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "EXCLUSIONARY TIME-OUT physically removes person from reinforcing environment to less reinforcing area (time-out room, different area of room, hallway). NON-EXCLUSIONARY keeps person in environment but denies access to reinforcement (sitting in chair watching others, removing materials). Exclusionary is more restrictive.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "FCT teaches functionally equivalent communication response (FER) that achieves the SAME outcome as problem behavior but appropriately. If tantrum = escape, teach 'break please.' If aggression = attention, teach 'help please.' The replacement produces same reinforcer more efficiently. This is DRA (differential reinforcement of alternative) with communication focus. Combines assessment, mand training, and extinction.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "RATE = COUNT ÷ TIME. Rate standardizes frequency across different time periods, allowing comparison. Example: 10 responses in 20 minutes = 0.5 responses/minute. Rate is essential when observation periods vary in length. Frequency (count) alone doesn't account for time differences. Rate is responses per unit time (per minute, per hour, per day).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "PARTIAL INTERVAL marks interval if behavior occurs AT ANY TIME during interval, tending to OVERESTIMATE behavior (especially brief or low-rate behaviors). Even 1 second of behavior in 30-second interval = scored. Better for measuring decrease in behavior. WHOLE INTERVAL (behavior throughout entire interval) UNDERESTIMATES.

      "explanation": "TRIALS-TO-CRITERION measures acquisition efficiency - how many teaching attempts (trials) are required to reach a predetermined mastery level (e.g., 90% accuracy across 3 sessions). Lower trials-to-criterion indicates faster learning. Useful for comparing teaching procedures or tracking learning across skills. Not duration, rate, or IRT.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "PREFERENCE ASSESSMENTS identify items/activities the individual prefers, which can then be tested as potential reinforcers. Preference ≠ reinforcer (preference is liking; reinforcer is functional increase in behavior), but preferred items are more likely to function as reinforcers. Types: Paired choice (MS), multiple stimulus with replacement (MSW), multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO), free operant, ask methods.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "PAIRED-STIMULUS (Fisher et al., 1992) presents ALL possible pairs of items, one pair at a time. Individual makes forced choice between two items. Each item is paired with every other item. Selections are tallied - most frequently chosen = most preferred. More time-consuming than MSWO but provides detailed preference hierarchy.

      "explanation": "STIMULUS PROMPTS modify the SD itself by adding cues (highlighting, color-coding, size, position, movement). Example: Making correct answer card larger. RESPONSE PROMPTS involve assistance with the response (physical guidance, modeling, verbal instructions). Stimulus prompts are often easier to fade (gradually reduce the modification).

      "explanation": "SUFFICIENT EXEMPLAR TRAINING (multiple exemplars) promotes STIMULUS GENERALIZATION by training across enough different examples that the learner extracts the relevant dimensions and responds correctly to novel stimuli. Teach 'dog' with pictures of multiple dog breeds, sizes, colors → child identifies new dogs. Variation in training = variation in generalization. Critical for real-world application.",

      "explanation": "TOKEN ECONOMY advantage: Tokens are CONDITIONED REINFORCERS that bridge delay between behavior and backup reinforcer. Provide immediate token → exchange later for backup reinforcer. Also allows accumulation, less satiation, practical in group settings. Tokens MUST be exchanged (or they lose value).

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "LISTENER BEHAVIOR is NONVERBAL behavior under control of VERBAL STIMULI (words, signs as SDs). Following instructions ('touch nose' → touching nose) is listener behavior, not speaker behavior. The verbal stimulus functions as an SD. Different from speaker behavior (mand, tact, echoic, intraverbal). Listener skills are prerequisites for many learning activities.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When ECHOIC-like behavior (vocal imitation) occurs due to AUTOMATIC REINFORCEMENT (sounds feel/sound good) rather than social reinforcement, it's VOCAL STEREOTYPY or SELF-ECHOIC. Has point-to-point correspondence but isn't controlled by social consequences or discriminative stimulus. Example: Child repeats phrases from movies for sensory stimulation. Different from functional echoics (socially reinforced) or tacts/mands.",

      "explanation": "REINFORCEMENT is any consequence that INCREASES the future probability/frequency of behavior. Must be functional (actually increase behavior), not assumed. Two types: Positive (adding stimulus) and Negative (removing aversive stimulus). Punishment decreases behavior. Extinction withholds reinforcement. Habituation is decreased responding to repeated stimulus.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "PREMACK PRINCIPLE: HIGH-probability behaviors (preferred activities) can function as reinforcers for LOW-probability behaviors (less preferred). 'First-then' contingencies: 'First do homework (low-prob), then play video games (high-prob).' Identifies potential reinforcers by observing what individual chooses to do when free to choose.

      "explanation": "HABIT REVERSAL (Azrin & Nunn, 1973) combines: (1) AWARENESS TRAINING - recognizing early warning signs/chain of habit, and (2) COMPETING RESPONSE TRAINING - engaging in behavior physically incompatible with habit for 1-3 minutes. Used for habits like nail-biting, hair-pulling, tics. May include motivation procedures, social support. Effective for automaticallyoperated behaviors.",
