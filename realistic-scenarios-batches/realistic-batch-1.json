    "scenario": "A BCBA is consulting with a 8-year-old client with autism spectrum disorder in a general education classroom. The client engages in screaming behavior that is disrupting therapy sessions. ABC data collected over 5 weeks (54 observation sessions) shows screaming occurs an average of 22 times per hour during reading assignments. When demands are paused, the screaming behavior immediately decreases to near-zero. During preferred subjects, screaming occurs only 1 time per session. The parent reports the behavior is most problematic during non-preferred reading assignments.",
    "question": "Based on this ABC data pattern and the antecedent-behavior-consequence relationships observed, what function is the screaming behavior most likely serving?",
    "options": [
      "Access to preferred tangible items or activities",
      "Escape or avoidance of aversive tasks or demands",
      "Access to social attention from adults or peers",
      "Automatic or sensory reinforcement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The data strongly indicates an escape function maintained by negative reinforcement. Multiple converging evidence points support this conclusion: (1) The behavior occurs at elevated rates (22 per session) specifically and consistently during non-preferred or difficult academic tasks (reading assignments), showing clear antecedent control, (2) The behavior reliably terminates or produces removal of the aversive task, demonstrating the maintaining consequence (negative reinforcement), (3) The behavior rate is near-zero (1 instances) during preferred activities when escape is not relevant, (4) The pattern is consistent across 5 weeks of systematic observation. This is a textbook example of escape-maintained behavior. Alternative hypotheses are not supported: Automatic reinforcement would show similar rates across all conditions regardless of task demands. Attention function would show increases when attention is provided contingent on behavior. Tangible function would correlate with presence/absence of specific items, not task demands. The functional relationship between demands and behavior termination clearly indicates escape as the maintaining variable.",
