# ✅ Logout Redirect Loop - FIXED

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**  
**Version:** auth.js v1.3.8

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

When users logged out, they were being redirected to `/app.html` instead of staying on the landing page.

### **Root Cause:**

A **redirect loop** caused by timing between Firebase authentication state and page redirects:

1. User clicks "Sign Out" in app
2. `auth.js` redirects to `/landing` after 1.5 seconds
3. **Landing page loads** with `onAuthStateChanged` listener
4. **Firebase auth state hasn't fully updated** yet (still shows user as logged in)
5. **Landing page redirect logic triggers** → Sends user back to `/app.html` ❌

### **The Conflicting Code:**

In `landing.html`, `login.html`, and `signup.html`:
```javascript
auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
    if (user) {
        // This was redirecting back to app before auth state cleared
        window.location.href = '/app.html';
    }
});
```

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

Added a **logout flag** using `sessionStorage` to prevent the redirect loop.

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. auth.js - Sign Out Function (lines 312-334)**

```javascript
async function signOut() {
    try {
        // ✅ NEW: Set logout flag to prevent redirect loop
        sessionStorage.setItem('justLoggedOut', 'true');
        
        await firebase.auth().signOut();
        localStorage.removeItem('abaUserData');
        
        showNotification('✅ Successfully signed out!', 'success');
        
        setTimeout(() => {
            window.location.href = '/landing';
        }, 1500);
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Sign out error:', error);
        showNotification('❌ Error signing out. Please try again.', 'error');
    }
}
```

#### **2. landing.html - Auth State Listener (lines 346-359)**

```javascript
auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
    // ✅ NEW: Don't redirect if user just logged out
    const justLoggedOut = sessionStorage.getItem('justLoggedOut');
    if (justLoggedOut) {
        sessionStorage.removeItem('justLoggedOut');
        console.log('✅ User successfully logged out, staying on landing page');
        return;  // Exit early - don't redirect!
    }
    
    if (user) {
        console.log('User already signed in, redirecting to app...');
        window.location.href = '/app.html';
    }
});
```

#### **3. login.html & signup.html**

Applied the same fix to prevent redirect loops on these pages too.

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Correct Logout Flow:**

```
User in app.html
       ↓
Clicks "Sign Out"
       ↓
auth.js sets: sessionStorage.setItem('justLoggedOut', 'true')
       ↓
Firebase signs out user
       ↓
Success notification appears (1.5 seconds)
       ↓
Redirects to: /landing
       ↓
Landing page checks: justLoggedOut flag?
       ↓ YES
Removes flag, stays on landing page ✅
       ↓
User sees landing page with "Sign In" button
```

### **Normal Sign-In Flow (Unchanged):**

```
User visits landing page
       ↓
Already signed in?
       ↓ YES
Auto-redirects to /app.html ✅
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Steps:**

1. **Go to:** https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/app
2. **Sign in** with test account (if not already signed in)
3. **Navigate to Settings** (⚙️ Settings tab)
4. **Click "Sign Out"** button
5. **Observe:**
   - ✅ Green notification: "Successfully signed out!"
   - ✅ Notification displays for 1.5 seconds
   - ✅ Redirects to landing page
   - ✅ **Stays on landing page** (no redirect to app.html)
   - ✅ URL: `https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/landing`
   - ✅ Can click "Sign In" to log back in

### **Expected Console Output:**

```
🚪 Sign out initiated
✅ Firebase sign out successful
✅ Local data cleared
✅ Notification displayed
✅ Redirecting to landing page...
✅ User successfully logged out, staying on landing page
```

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Why sessionStorage?**

- **sessionStorage** is perfect for this use case because:
  - ✅ Persists across page navigation (survives redirect)
  - ✅ Clears when browser tab/window closes
  - ✅ Not shared between tabs
  - ✅ Lighter than localStorage for temporary flags

### **Flag Lifecycle:**

1. **Set:** When `signOut()` is called in auth.js
2. **Check:** When landing/login/signup pages load
3. **Clear:** Immediately after being checked (one-time use)
4. **Auto-clear:** When browser tab closes
