## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION STATES

### **1. Guest Mode** (Default):

```
Status: Not logged in
Data Storage: localStorage only (on your device)
Visibility: Sign Out button hidden
Behavior: Full app functionality, data stays local
```

**Use Case**: Quick study without needing an account

---

### **2. Logged In Mode**:

```
Status: Authenticated with Firebase
Data Storage: Firestore (cloud) + localStorage (local cache)
Visibility: Sign Out button visible
Behavior: Full app + cloud sync + cross-device access
```

**Use Case**: Study across multiple devices, data backed up

---

## 💻 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Implementation**:

**HTML** (`index.html`):
- New "Account" section in Settings view
- User status text (`user-status`)
- Sign Out button (`sign-out-btn`)
- Button hidden by default (CSS `display: none`)

**JavaScript** (`index.html` inline + `app.js`):
- `updateAuthUI(user)`: Updates UI based on auth state
- `handleSignOut()`: Handles sign out with confirmation
- Event listener: Connects button to sign out function
- Firebase auth integration: `auth.signOut()`

**Firebase Integration**:
- Uses existing Firebase Auth SDK
- Syncs with `auth.onAuthStateChanged()` listener
- Updates UI automatically when auth state changes
- Preserves data in Firestore
