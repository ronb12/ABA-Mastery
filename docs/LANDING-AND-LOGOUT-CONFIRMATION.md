## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the landing page"
- Clear cache and reload
- Visit root URL: https://aba-mastery-app.web.app
- Not `/app` - just the root domain

### "I can't find the sign out button"
- Click 👤 icon in top-right
- Wait for dropdown to appear
- Scroll to the **bottom** of dropdown
- It's in the footer section (last item)

### "Sign out button says 'Guest Mode'"
- That's correct! You're in guest mode
- When you sign in, it will say "Sign Out"
- Click it to see guest mode info

### "Landing page redirects to app immediately"
- This means you're signed in already
- That's the intended behavior
- Sign out first to see landing page
