# ✅ Page Navigation Fixed - Landing Page Now Shows!

**Issue**: Landing/login page not showing at root URL  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED and DEPLOYED**  
**Date**: October 18, 2025

## 🐛 The Problem

When visiting https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/, users were seeing:
- ❌ The main app (study platform)
- ❌ NOT the landing page

**Expected**: Beautiful landing page with "Start Studying" button  
**Actual**: Main app loaded directly  

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Firebase Hosting Default Behavior:**
- When both `index.html` and rewrites exist, Firebase serves `index.html` by default at the root path (`/`)
- This happens BEFORE checking the rewrites configuration
- Our `firebase.json` said: "/" → landing.html
- But Firebase served `index.html` instead
- Result: Landing page was ignored!

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **Solution:**
1. Renamed `index.html` to `_index.html.bak` (backup)
2. Updated `firebase.json` routing:
   - `/app` → `app.html` (main application)
   - `**` (all other paths) → `landing.html` (landing page)
3. Removed the conflict
4. Redeployed to Firebase

### **Result:**
- ✅ Root URL (/) now shows landing page
- ✅ /app URL shows main application
- ✅ Navigation flow works perfectly
- ✅ No more conflicts!

## 🗺️ New URL Routing

### **Working URLs:**

| URL | Shows | File |
|-----|-------|------|
| https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/ | Landing Page | landing.html |
| https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/app | Main App | app.html |
| Any other path | Landing Page | landing.html |
