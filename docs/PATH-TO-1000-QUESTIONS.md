## 🚀 MY RECOMMENDATION

**BUILD THE FEATURES** that make your app better than competitors, even with 200-250 questions!

**Why?**
- ✅ Calculation module is **unique** (competitors don't have this)
- ✅ Adaptive learning makes 200 questions work like 500
- ✅ Case studies provide high-value practice
- ✅ These features take your app from "good" to "exceptional"

**Then**, systematically expand to 1,000 over next 3-6 months.

2. **Content Heavy** - Focus on reaching 400-500 questions this session
