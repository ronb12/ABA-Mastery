## 🎯 Maintenance

### **Monitoring**

Check Firebase Console periodically:
- Firestore database size (should stay under 1 GB)
- Number of files stored
- If approaching 1 GB, users will naturally shift to external links

### **Optimization Tips**

1. **Compress images** before upload (reduce by 50-70%)
2. **Educate users** on external links for large files
3. **Set per-user limits** (e.g., 5 small files per user)
4. **Auto-delete old files** after 90 days (optional)
5. **Premium tier** gets priority storage (future monetization)

### **Future Enhancements**

- Automatic image compression
- Bulk external link upload
- File preview for small files
- Folder organization
- File search functionality
