## ⚠️ WHAT'S MISSING (GAPS)

### **Critical Gaps for Exam Readiness:**

#### **1. Insufficient Question Volume** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**Current**: 100 questions  
**Real Exam**: 185 questions (BCBA), 130 questions (BCaBA)  
**Industry Standard**: 500-1,500 practice questions  
**Recommendation**: Users need 3-5x more practice than the actual exam

**Why This Matters**:
- Students need to see concepts multiple ways
- Reduces memorization, increases understanding
- Covers edge cases and variations
- Builds confidence through repetition

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🔴 **HIGH**  
**Solution**: Expand to 500 questions (Phase 1)

---

#### **2. Limited Ethics Content** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Current**: ~8 ethics questions  
**Needed**: 20-30 questions (ethics is 10-15% of exam)  
**Gap**: 15-20 questions short

**Why This Matters**:
- Ethics violations can end careers
- Often scenario-based and nuanced
- Requires practice with gray areas
- Common area where students struggle

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH**  
**Solution**: Add 20+ ethics scenarios immediately

---

#### **3. Limited Supervision Content** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current**: ~5 questions  
**Needed**: 15-20 questions  
**Gap**: 10-15 questions short

**Missing Topics**:
- ❌ Specific RBT supervision requirements (5% + monthly contact)
- ❌ BCaBA supervision requirements
- ❌ Behavioral Skills Training (BST) process
- ❌ Performance feedback models
- ❌ Fieldwork documentation

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Solution**: Add 15+ supervision questions

---

#### **4. No Calculation Practice Module** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current**: 3 calculation questions  
**Needed**: 15-20 calculation problems with step-by-step solutions  

**Missing Calculations**:
- ❌ Multiple IOA variations (interval-by-interval, scored-interval, exact agreement)
- ❌ Rate to frequency conversions
- ❌ Duration per occurrence
- ❌ Percentage of intervals
- ❌ Treatment integrity calculations

**Why This Matters**:
- Calculation questions appear on every exam
- Often worth 5-10% of total score
- Students need practice with formulas
- Mistakes are costly

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Solution**: Create dedicated calculation practice module

---

#### **5. No Case Study Scenarios** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current**: 0 case studies  
**Needed**: 25-50 comprehensive scenarios  

**Why This Matters**:
- Real exam has complex scenario questions
- Tests application, not just recall
- Requires integrating multiple concepts
- Reflects real-world decision-making

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Solution**: Create 25+ multi-question case studies

---

#### **6. Limited Question Variations** ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current**: 1-2 questions per specific concept  
**Needed**: 3-5 questions per concept  

**Why This Matters**:
- Reduces risk of memorization
- Tests understanding from different angles
- Covers edge cases
- Builds mastery, not recognition

**Impact on Pass Rate**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Solution**: Add variations of existing topics
