  {topicId: 'measurement-1', category: 'partial-interval',
   title: 'On-Task Behavior',
   scenario: 'Measure student on-task behavior during 20-minute work period.',
   intervention: 'Divide into 20 one-minute intervals. Mark interval if behavior occurred AT ANY TIME during interval.',
   result: 'On-task in 14 of 20 intervals = 70% on-task.',

   title: 'Sustained Attention',
   scenario: 'Measure sustained eye contact with materials.',
   intervention: 'Use 10-second intervals. Mark only if behavior occurred for ENTIRE 10 seconds.',
   result: 'Sustained attention in 6 of 30 intervals = 20%.',
   principle: 'Whole interval recording - conservative measure, underestimates behavior'},
   
  {topicId: 'measurement-1', category: 'momentary-time-sampling',
   title: 'Group Engagement',
   scenario: 'Measure if 5 students are engaged at various times during 30-min class.',
   intervention: 'Set timer to beep every 3 minutes (10 intervals). Record whether EACH student engaged at moment of beep.',
   result: 'Student A: 8/10 (80%), Student B: 6/10 (60%), etc.',
   principle: 'Momentary time sampling - record behavior status only at specific moments'},

  // IOA Examples (6)
  {topicId: 'ioa-1', category: 'interval-ioa',

   scenario: 'Two observers recorded on-task behavior using 10 intervals.',

   scenario: 'Need to identify reinforcers for 4-year-old.',

   result: 'Car: 80%, Ball: 60%, Blocks: 40%, Puzzle: 30%, Doll: 20%, Book: 15%. Use car and ball as reinforcers.',

  {topicId: 'preference-assessment-1', category: 'mswo',
   title: 'Multiple Stimulus Without Replacement',
   scenario: 'Quickly identify reinforcer hierarchy.',
   intervention: 'Present array of 5 toys. Child selects one (removed). Re-present remaining 4. Continue until all selected.',
   result: 'Selection order: Tablet → Blocks → Car → Ball → Book. Use tablet and blocks as primary reinforcers.',
