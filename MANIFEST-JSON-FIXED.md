# ✅ Manifest.json Fixed!

## Date: October 19, 2025

---

## ⚠️ **Problem:**

`manifest.json` was **EMPTY** (another corrupted file from the git issues).

This caused a console error:
```
manifest.json:1 Manifest: Line: 1, column: 1, Syntax error.
```

---

## ✅ **Solution:**

Created a proper `manifest.json` with:
- ✅ App name and description
- ✅ Icons (192x192 and 512x512)
- ✅ PWA settings (standalone, theme colors)
- ✅ Shortcuts (Study Now, Flashcards)
- ✅ Categories (education, productivity)

---

## 📋 **Files Corrupted So Far:**

| File | Status | When Fixed |
|------|--------|------------|
| `index.html` | ✅ Fixed | Earlier today |
| `package.json` | ✅ Fixed | Earlier today |
| `content.json` | ✅ Fixed | Earlier today (user ran curl) |
| `.git/config` | ✅ Fixed | Earlier today |
| `manifest.json` | ✅ Fixed | Just now |
| `app.js` | ❓ Checking | Now |

---

## 🚀 **Deploy All Fixes:**

Now that manifest.json is fixed, deploy everything:

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This will deploy:
1. ✅ `index.html` - Redirect to landing
2. ✅ `landing.html` - Features modal
3. ✅ `firebase.json` - Routing
4. ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies
5. ✅ `manifest.json` - PWA config (just fixed!)
6. ✅ `content.json` - Study content
7. ✅ All other files

---

## 📊 **After Deploy:**

1. Visit: https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/
2. Landing page should load correctly
3. No more manifest.json error in console
4. Features modal button works
5. PWA can be installed properly

---

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**

All these corruptions came from running `git reset` on an already-corrupted repository earlier today. It cascaded and emptied multiple files:
- index.html
- package.json  
- content.json
- manifest.json
- Potentially others

We've been finding and fixing them one by one.
