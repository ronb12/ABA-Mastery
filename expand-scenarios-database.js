    scenario: 'A behavior technician is collecting data on task engagement during a 30-minute work session. The session is divided into 30 one-minute intervals. The technician marks an interval as "engaged" if the client looks at task materials at ANY point during that minute, even if only for 2-3 seconds. At the end of the session, 25 of 30 intervals are marked as engaged.',
    question: 'What measurement system is being used, and what is a primary limitation of this approach?',
    options: [
      'Whole interval recording; it overestimates the occurrence of behavior',
      'Partial interval recording; it overestimates the occurrence of behavior',
      'Momentary time sampling; it may miss brief instances of behavior',
      'Frequency recording; it does not capture duration information'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'This is partial interval recording (recording if behavior occurs at any point during the interval). The primary limitation is that it OVERESTIMATES behavior occurrence, especially for brief or intermittent behaviors. Even if engagement only occurred for 3 seconds of a 60-second interval, that interval is scored as "engaged." This inflates the percentage. Whole interval recording would UNDERESTIMATE (requires behavior throughout entire interval). Momentary time sampling records only at the moment of observation. This is not frequency recording as it measures intervals, not discrete instances.',

    scenario: 'Two observers independently collect data on tantrum behavior using 10-second partial interval recording during a 10-minute session (60 intervals total). Observer 1 records tantrums in 42 intervals. Observer 2 records tantrums in 38 intervals. There are 35 intervals where both observers agreed that tantrums occurred, and 15 intervals where both agreed NO tantrum occurred.',
    question: 'What is the interval-by-interval IOA (Interobserver Agreement) for this observation session?',

      '58% (35 agreements √∑ 60 total intervals)'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'Interval-by-interval IOA is calculated as: (Agreements √∑ Total Intervals) √ó 100. Agreements include BOTH intervals where observers agreed behavior occurred (35) AND intervals where they agreed it did NOT occur (15) = 50 total agreements. Total intervals = 60. Therefore: (50 √∑ 60) √ó 100 = 83.3%. Option A incorrectly uses only Observer 1\'s total. Option B incorrectly uses Observer 2\'s total. Option D incorrectly excludes agreements on non-occurrence. This IOA method is conservative and accounts for both types of agreement.',

When intervention is introduced for each student, their problem behavior decreases substantially within 2-3 sessions.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'This is a multiple baseline design across participants. Key features: (1) Three similar participants, (2) Staggered introduction of intervention at different times, (3) Baseline continues for non-intervention participants while intervention is applied to others. This design demonstrates experimental control by showing that behavior changes only when intervention is introduced for each participant, ruling out confounding variables like maturation or history. If an external factor caused the change, all three would improve simultaneously. The staggered introduction demonstrates the IV (intervention) is responsible for the DV (behavior change). Not alternating treatments (compares multiple treatments). Not changing criterion (gradually shifts criterion). Not withdrawal (doesn\'t remove intervention).',

    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'This is a tact - verbal behavior under the control of a nonverbal stimulus (the dog) that produces generalized conditioned reinforcement (praise). Tacts are essentially labels or descriptions of the environment. Key indicators: (1) Nonverbal stimulus (dog) is present, (2) No mand frame (child isn\'t requesting), (3) No verbal antecedent (ruling out echoic and intraverbal), (4) Generalized reinforcement (praise, not access to dog). Mands are requests under MO control. Echoics require a verbal model with point-to-point correspondence. Intraverbals are verbal-verbal relations without correspondence. Tact training is fundamental for language development.',
