    "options": [
      "10% of service hours with any supervisor",
      "5% of service hours with a BCBA or BCaBA, including at least one face-to-face contact per month",
      "One hour per month only",
      "No specific requirements"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "RBTs must receive ongoing supervision comprising at least 5% of the hours they spend providing behavior-analytic services per supervisory period, with at least one face-to-face, synchronous contact per supervisory period. Supervision must be provided by a BCBA or BCaBA. This ensures quality services, supports RBT development, and maintains ethical standards. Supervisors are responsible for services delivered by their supervisees."

    "question": "An RBT provides 20 hours of direct service per week. What is the MINIMUM supervision required per month?",
    "options": [
      "1 hour per month",
      "4 hours per month (5% of 80 monthly hours)",
      "5 hours per month",
      "10 hours per month"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "RBTs require 5% of service hours as supervision. For 20 hours/week Ã— 4 weeks = 80 hours per month. 5% of 80 = 4 hours of supervision per month minimum. Additionally, at least one contact must be face-to-face/synchronous each supervisory period. Supervision includes direct observation, feedback, reviewing data, training, and addressing concerns. This ensures RBTs practice competently and ethically."

    "options": [
      "A certification program",
      "A training method involving instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback",
      "A type of therapy for children",
      "A data collection system"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Behavioral Skills Training (BST) is an evidence-based staff training method with four components: 1) Instruction (describe the skill), 2) Modeling (demonstrate the skill), 3) Rehearsal (trainee practices), and 4) Feedback (specific praise and corrective feedback). BST is effective for teaching discrete skills to staff and has strong research support. It ensures staff can perform procedures correctly before working independently with clients. Competency-based training protects client welfare."

      "Reduce the supervisor's workload",
      "Meet billing requirements only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Clinical supervision serves two primary purposes: ensuring clients receive quality, ethical services, and supporting supervisee professional development. Effective supervision includes: direct observation, performance feedback, reviewing client data, teaching new skills, addressing ethical issues, and providing support. Supervision protects clients, develops competent professionals, and maintains field standards. It's not punitive but developmental and quality-assurance focused."

    "question": "A supervisor observes an RBT implementing a procedure incorrectly during a session. What should the supervisor do immediately?",
    "options": [
      "Wait until after the session to provide feedback",
      "Intervene immediately to protect client safety, then provide feedback and retraining",
      "Document the error but say nothing",
      "Fire the RBT"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "When client safety or treatment integrity is compromised, immediate intervention is required. The supervisor should: stop the incorrect procedure, model the correct procedure, ensure client safety, then provide specific feedback and retraining. Documentation should follow. Less serious errors can be addressed after sessions. The goal is client protection and staff development, not punishment. Follow-up includes verifying the RBT can perform correctly and increased monitoring until competence is demonstrated."

      "Specific, immediate, and balanced (positive and corrective)",
      "Only negative to motivate improvement",
      "Given only during annual reviews"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Effective feedback is: specific (describe exactly what was done well/needs improvement), immediate (as soon as possible after observation), balanced (acknowledge strengths and areas for growth), objective (based on observable behavior), and actionable (clear about what to do differently). Regular, ongoing feedback is more effective than infrequent reviews. Positive feedback maintains motivation, while specific corrective feedback guides improvement. The feedback sandwich (positive-corrective-positive) can be effective."

      "Only problems that occurred",
      "Nothing - supervision doesn't need documentation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Comprehensive supervision documentation includes: dates and duration, activities conducted (observation, case review, training), specific skills or cases addressed, feedback provided, supervisee performance and progress, goals for next supervision, and supervisor signature. Documentation provides accountability, tracks supervisee development, supports credentialing, and protects both parties. It should be detailed enough to demonstrate adequate oversight and support continuity if supervisors change."

      "Advanced procedures to learn faster",
      "Without supervision once hired"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Supervisees must practice only within their scope of competence as determined by training and demonstrated skill. New procedures require training, supervised practice, and competency demonstration before independent implementation. This protects clients from harm due to supervisee inexperience. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring supervisees don't exceed their competence. Graduated independence based on demonstrated skill is appropriate."

    "options": [
      "Terminate the supervisee",
      "Provide additional training using BST, increase monitoring, and consider if the skill is within supervisee's current capabilities",
      "Ignore it and hope they improve",
      "Assign them only easy cases"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "When supervisees struggle, supervisors should: provide additional targeted training (possibly using BST), increase direct observation and feedback, break skills into smaller steps, model the skill repeatedly, provide more practice opportunities with feedback, and assess if the task is appropriate for the supervisee's current skill level. Some tasks may require more experience or training than the supervisee currently has. The goal is development, not punishment. Persistent difficulties despite good training may indicate need for different role or additional foundational skills."

      "There is no difference",

      "Supervision is free; consultation costs money",
      "Consultation is always better than supervision"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Supervision involves an ongoing relationship where the supervisor has responsibility for the supervisee's professional development and client services. The supervisor provides oversight, evaluation, and direc.tion. Consultation is a peer relationship where an expert provides advice or recommendations, but the consultee retains professional responsibility and decision-making authority. Consultants don't have ongoing oversight responsibility. Both are valuable but serve different purposes and have different ethical obligations."
