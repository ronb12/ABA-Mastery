# ✅ Service Worker Redirect Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**  
**Version:** sw.js v1.3.9

---

## 🐛 **The Real Problem**

The **Service Worker** was intercepting navigation requests and blocking redirects, causing this error:

```
The FetchEvent for "<URL>" resulted in a network error response: 
a redirected response was used for a request whose redirect mode is not "follow".
```

This was preventing the logout redirect from working properly.

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

Updated the Service Worker to:
1. **Skip intercepting navigation requests** (allows redirects to work naturally)
2. **Skip auth-related pages** (landing, login, signup)
3. **Handle redirects properly** with `redirect: 'follow'`
4. **Don't cache redirect responses**

### **Changes Made:**

#### **sw.js - Fetch Event Handler (lines 61-112)**

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    // ✅ NEW: Skip service worker for authentication and navigation redirects
    if (event.request.mode === 'navigate' || 
        event.request.url.includes('/landing') ||
        event.request.url.includes('/login') ||
        event.request.url.includes('/signup') ||
        event.request.url.includes('firebase')) {
        // Let the browser handle navigation and auth naturally
        return;  // Don't intercept!
    }
    
    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request)
            .then(response => {
                if (response) {
                    return response;
                }
                
                // ✅ NEW: Set redirect mode to 'follow'
                return fetch(event.request.clone(), { redirect: 'follow' })
                    .then(response => {
                        // ✅ NEW: Don't cache redirects
                        if (response.type === 'opaque' || response.redirected) {
                            return response;
                        }
                        
                        // Cache other resources
                        if (response && response.status === 200) {
                            const responseToCache = response.clone();
                            caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
                                cache.put(event.request, responseToCache);
                            });
                        }
                        
                        return response;
                    });
            })
    );
});
```

## 🔄 **How to Clear the Old Service Worker**

### **Method 1: Unregister via Developer Console (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Open your app:** https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/app
2. **Open Developer Console:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Option + J`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + J`
3. **Go to Application tab** (Chrome) or **Storage tab** (Firefox)
4. **Click "Service Workers"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click "Unregister"** next to the service worker
6. **Check "Update on reload"** checkbox
7. **Hard refresh:** `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### **Method 2: Clear via Console Command**

1. **Open Developer Console** (steps above)
2. **Paste this command:**

```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
    for(let registration of registrations) {
        registration.unregister();
        console.log('✅ Service Worker unregistered:', registration);
    }
}).then(() => {
    console.log('✅ All service workers cleared! Now refresh the page.');
});
```

3. **Press Enter**
4. **Hard refresh the page:** `Cmd+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`
5. **New service worker will install automatically**

### **Method 3: Clear All Site Data (NUCLEAR OPTION)**

1. **Open Developer Console**
2. **Application/Storage tab**
3. **Click "Clear site data"** button
4. **Refresh the page**

---

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix**

After clearing the service worker:

1. **Go to:** https://aba-mastery-app.web.app/app
2. **Open Console** and verify you see:
   ```
   Service Worker registered
   Service Worker installing...
   Service Worker activating...
   ```
3. **Sign in** (if not already)
4. **Go to Settings**
5. **Click "Sign Out"**
6. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ Green notification: "Successfully signed out!"
   - ✅ Redirect to landing page after 1.5 seconds
   - ✅ **Stays on landing page** (no redirect to app.html)
   - ✅ No service worker errors in console

### **Console Output (Success):**

```
Service Worker registered
✅ User successfully logged out, staying on landing page
```

### **Console Output (If Still Failing):**

```
The FetchEvent for "<URL>" resulted in a network error...
```

If you still see this error, the old service worker is still active. Try Method 2 above.

## 📊 **What Changed**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Service worker intercepts ALL requests | ✅ Skips navigation and auth requests |
| ❌ Redirect mode not specified | ✅ Uses `redirect: 'follow'` |
| ❌ Caches redirect responses | ✅ Doesn't cache redirects |
| ❌ Blocks logout redirect | ✅ Allows logout redirect |
| ❌ Network errors on redirects | ✅ No errors |

---

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

### **Navigation Requests:**
When you navigate to a different page (like logout → landing), the browser makes a **navigation request**. The old service worker was intercepting these and not handling redirects properly.

**New behavior:**
- Navigation requests → **Skip service worker** → Browser handles naturally
- Auth pages (landing, login, signup) → **Skip service worker**
- Other resources (CSS, JS, images) → **Use service worker cache**

### **Redirect Handling:**
The old service worker didn't specify `redirect: 'follow'`, so it was using the default `redirect: 'manual'`, which requires special handling.

**New behavior:**
- Set `redirect: 'follow'` → Automatically follows redirects
- Don't cache redirected responses → Only cache final resources
- Check for `response.redirected` → Skip caching if it was a redirect
