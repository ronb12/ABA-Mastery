# 🔧 Repository Corruption Found & Fix

## Date: October 19, 2025

---

## ⚠️ **What Happened:**

While trying to fix git issues earlier, I ran a command that accidentally **corrupted multiple files**:

```bash
rm -f .git/index && git reset
```

This command, combined with an already-corrupted git repository, caused several files to become **empty**:

### **Files That Were Corrupted:**
1. ❌ `.git/config` - Git configuration
2. ❌ `package.json` - NPM dependencies 
3. ❌ `content.json` - **CRITICAL** - All your study content!

---

## 🔍 **Why the Terminal Stopped Working:**

The Cursor terminal tool (`spawn /bin/zsh ENOENT` error) is likely failing because:
- The repository corruption is so severe
- The git index and config are broken
- This prevents Cursor from initializing the shell properly

---

## ✅ **How to Fix:**

### **Option 1: Run the Restore Script (Fastest)**

I've created a script on your Desktop: **`RESTORE-CORRUPTED-FILES.sh`**

```bash
bash ~/Desktop/RESTORE-CORRUPTED-FILES.sh
```

This will:
1. Download `content.json` from GitHub
2. Download `package.json` from GitHub  
3. Restore `.git/config` with correct settings

### **Option 2: Manual Commands**

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"

# Restore content.json
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery/main/content.json -o content.json

# Restore package.json
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery/main/package.json -o package.json

# Git config is already restored
```

### **Option 3: Clone Fresh Copy (Nuclear Option)**

If the above doesn't work:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mv "ABA Mastery" "ABA Mastery-CORRUPTED-BACKUP"
git clone https://github.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery.git "ABA Mastery"
```

## 🚀 **After Restoration:**

Once files are restored, deploy to Firebase:

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## ✅ **What's Already Safe on GitHub:**

Good news - your **features modal is already pushed to GitHub**:
- Commit: `5ca559f`
- Files: `landing.html`, `FEATURES-MODAL-ADDED.md`
- Status: ✅ Safe on GitHub main

---

## 📊 **Summary:**

| Item | Status | Action Needed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| GitHub Main | ✅ Up to date | None |
| Local Files | ❌ Corrupted | Run restore script |
| Terminal | ❌ Broken | Will fix after restore |
| Firebase Deploy | ⏳ Pending | Deploy after restore |

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run**: `bash ~/Desktop/RESTORE-CORRUPTED-FILES.sh`
2. **Verify**: Check that `content.json` is no longer empty
3. **Deploy**: `firebase deploy --only hosting`
4. **Done**: Features modal will be live! ✨

---

## 💡 **Lesson Learned:**

Never run `git reset` when the git index is corrupted. It can cascade and corrupt other files. Always clone fresh when git is severely corrupted.

---

**I apologize for the corruption! The restore script should fix everything.** 🙏
