    "question": "In implementing a DRO procedure, reinforcement is delivered when:",
    "options": [
      "Any appropriate behavior occurs",
      "A specific alternative behavior occurs",
      "The problem behavior has NOT occurred for a specified interval",
      "The problem behavior occurs at a low rate"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "DRO (Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior) delivers reinforcement based on the ABSENCE of the problem behavior for a predetermined time period. If the interval passes without the problem behavior occurring, reinforcement is delivered. If problem behavior occurs, the timer resets. This differs from DRA (specific alternative) and DRL (low rates). DRO is useful when a specific replacement hasn't been identified.",

    "id": "q199",
    "category": "intervention",
    "section": "G",
    "difficulty": "advanced",
    "question": "A student engages in hand-raising to escape difficult tasks. The BCBA teaches the student to request a break using a communication card. What is the MOST critical component to ensure success?",
    "options": [
      "Make the card visually appealing",
      "Ensure requesting a break produces the same reinforcer (escape) as hand-raising",
      "Teach card use in multiple settings first",
      "Punish hand-raising when it occurs"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "For FCT to be effective, the functional communication response (FCR) must produce the SAME reinforcer that maintained the problem behavior (functional equivalence). If hand-raising = escape, the break card must also = escape, and should be more efficient. The FCR must be an easier way to get the same outcome. Visual appeal, generalization, and punishment are secondary considerations. Functional equivalence is essential.",

    "id": "q200",
    "category": "intervention",
    "section": "G",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a reinforcer assessment?",
    "options": [
      "To identify the function of problem behavior",
      "To determine which items/activities function as reinforcers for an individual",
      "To measure baseline levels of behavior",
      "To assess developmental level"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "REINFORCER ASSESSMENT tests whether preferred items actually FUNCTION as reinforcers (increase behavior when provided contingently). Preference assessments identify what someone likes; reinforcer assessments verify those items increase behavior. Method: Present contingently and measure if behavior increases. This confirms items have reinforcing properties for that individual. Different from functional assessment (identifies function) or developmental assessment.",

        "Use of standardized rating scales",
        "Direct observation by a BCBA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An OPERATIONAL DEFINITION is essential for ALL FBA methods (indirect, descriptive, functional analysis). Without clear, observable, measurable definition of what behavior is being assessed, data collection is unreliable and function cannot be accurately determined. Experimental manipulation is only in FA. Standardized scales are optional. Direct observation by BCBA is ideal but trained staff can collect data.",

        "After 5 seconds",
        "After 5 minutes of no responding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "FIXED RATIO (FR) schedules deliver reinforcement after a FIXED number of responses. FR5 = reinforcement after exactly every 5th response (5, 10, 15, 20...). Produces high, steady rates with post-reinforcement pause. VARIABLE ratio would be average of 5. Interval schedules are time-based, not response-based. FR schedules are common in piecework, sales commissions, frequent flyer miles.",
