        title: 'Stimulus Equivalence',
        content: `Stimulus equivalence is a derived relation where stimuli become functionally interchangeable despite not being physically similar. It's the foundation for symbolic language and conceptual learning.\n\nTHREE PROPERTIES OF EQUIVALENCE:\n\nREFLEXIVITY (Identity Matching): Each stimulus is equivalent to itself (A=A). Without direct training, a learner matches identical stimuli. Example: Given the word "DOG," the learner selects the identical word "DOG" from an array. This demonstrates generalized identity matching. Reflexivity emerges through sufficient exemplar training in matching-to-sample procedures. It's the simplest equivalence relation - recognizing sameness.\n\nSYMMETRY (Bidirectionality): If trained A→B, then B→A emerges without additional training. The relation is reversible. Example: If you teach a child to match the spoken word "dog" to a picture of a dog (auditory→visual), they can then match the picture to the spoken word (visual→auditory) without that specific training. This demonstrates derived relational responding. Symmetry shows that stimulus relations aren't unidirectional but bidirectional. It's a hallmark of symbolic behavior - stimuli can function interchangeably regardless of which is sample and which is comparison.\n\nTRANSITIVITY (Derived Relations): If trained A→B and B→C, then A→C emerges without training. Example: Teach "dog" (word)→picture, and picture→actual dog. The learner can then match word→actual dog without that specific pairing being taught. Transitivity demonstrates that relations can be derived across a chain of trained relations. It shows true understanding rather than rote memorization.\n\nEQUIVALENCE CLASS FORMATION:\nWhen reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity all exist among a set of stimuli, they form an equivalence class. All stimuli in the class are functionally interchangeable. Example: The printed word "DOG," spoken word "dog," picture of dog, and actual dog can all substitute for each other. This is the basis of symbolic language - different forms (written, spoken, visual) can represent the same concept.\n\nMATCHING-TO-SAMPLE PROCEDURES:\nEquivalence is established and tested using matching-to-sample (MTS). In MTS, a sample stimulus is presented, and the learner selects a matching comparison from an array. Identity matching uses identical stimuli (picture to same picture). Arbitrary matching uses different stimuli (word to picture). Training establishes baseline relations (A→B, B→C), then tests for derived relations (A→C, C→A, B→A, C→B) without reinforcement.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE FOR LANGUAGE AND LEARNING:\nEquivalence allows for generative learning - new relations emerge without direct teaching. It's the foundation for symbolic behavior, reading comprehension, math understanding, and conceptual knowledge. Instead of teaching every possible relation, teach a few and many others derive. This is cognitively efficient and enables complex language. Equivalence makes symbolic communication possible - words, pictures, signs, and objects can all represent the same referent.\n\nCLINICAL APPLICATIONS:\nEquivalence training is used to teach reading (match written word→picture→spoken word), vocabulary in second languages, safety skills (symbol→meaning→action), and academic concepts. It's particularly valuable for learners with language delays. Once equivalence classes are established, training one member affects all members. If "CAR" (written)→car (picture) is in equivalence class, and you teach "car goes vroom," learners know "CAR goes vroom" without additional training.\n\nSIDMAN'S CONTRIBUTIONS:\nMurray Sidman's research established stimulus equivalence as a behavioral phenomenon. His work showed that equivalence emerges from conditional discrimination training and isn't explicitly taught. Sidman & Tailby (1982) formalized the defining properties (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity). This research challenged traditional views that symbolic relations must be explicitly taught, showing they can be derived through behavioral procedures.`,

        title: 'Derived Relational Responding',
        content: `Derived relational responding is responding to relations between stimuli without direct training. It goes beyond simple stimulus-response associations to understanding relationships.\n\nSTIMULUS RELATIONS:\nDerived relations include equivalence (same as), comparison (bigger/smaller, more/less), opposition (opposite of), distinction (different from), temporal (before/after), spatial (above/below), hierarchical (part-whole), and causal (if-then). These relations emerge without explicit training for each instance.\n\nRELATIONAL FRAME THEORY (RFT):\nRFT extends equivalence to all types of relational responding. It proposes that humans learn to respond relationally through multiple exemplar training. Once established, relational responding becomes generalized and applies to novel stimuli. This accounts for complex language and cognition. Relational frames include coordination (same as), opposition (opposite of), distinction (different from), comparison (more/less than), temporal (before/after), spatial (above/below), and hierarchical (part of).\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR LANGUAGE:\nDerived relations explain how humans understand metaphors, analogies, and abstract concepts. We can understand "love is a journey" without direct training on that specific relation. Relational responding is what makes human language generative and flexible.\n\nTEACHING DERIVED RELATIONS:\nUse multiple exemplar training across many contexts. Teach sufficient examples of relational responding (bigger than, opposite of, same as) until learners can apply the relation to novel stimuli. Reinforce correct relational responses and provide feedback. Once established, relational responding generalizes.`,

        title: 'Motor Imitation Training',
        content: `Motor imitation is matching a physical movement or action performed by a model. It's a foundational skill for learning through observation and social learning.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF IMITATION:\nImitation allows learning without trial-and-error. Children learn most daily skills through imitation: waving, clapping, using utensils, grooming, play skills. Without imitation, every skill must be directly taught through prompting and shaping. Imitation is a behavioral cusp - it opens access to learning from the natural environment by observing others.\n\nGENERALIZED IMITATION:\nThe ultimate goal is generalized imitation: imitating novel (never-taught) actions after observing a model. When generalized imitation is established, a learner will imitate new actions without specific training for each action. The discriminative stimulus "do this" or the model's action itself becomes a generalized SD.\n\nTEACHING MOTOR IMITATION - PROCEDURES:\n\nSTEP 1 - ESTABLISH ATTENDING: Ensure learner is attending to model. Use attention-getting prompts ("Look at me," touch shoulder). Wait for eye contact before modeling.\n\nSTEP 2 - SELECT STARTING ACTIONS: Begin with simple, discrete actions already in the learner's repertoire. Examples: clapping hands, touching nose, raising arms, stomping feet. Starting with known movements increases early success and allows focus on the imitation itself rather than acquiring new motor skills.\n\nSTEP 3 - PRESENT SD AND MODEL: Give discriminative stimulus ("Do this" or "Copy me") immediately followed by modeling the action. Model should be clear, distinct, and within learner's view. Hold the modeled position if possible.\n\nSTEP 4 - PROMPT IMITATION: If learner doesn't immediately imitate, use physical prompts (hand-over-hand guidance), gestural prompts (pointing to body parts), or verbal prompts ("Clap your hands"). Use least-to-most or most-to-least prompting hierarchies depending on learner needs.\n\nSTEP 5 - REINFORCE MATCHING: Immediately reinforce when learner's action matches model's action. Initially, reinforce any approximation. Gradually require closer matches. Reinforcement should be potent initially (primary reinforcers, preferred items) then fade to social reinforcers.\n\nSTEP 6 - FADE PROMPTS: Systematically fade prompts using time delay, graduated guidance, or least-to-most hierarchy. Goal is independent imitation after model only.\n\nSTEP 7 - TEACH MULTIPLE EXEMPLARS: Once a few actions are mastered with prompts faded, teach additional actions. Teach 10-15 different imitative responses. Vary: gross motor (jumping, standing), fine motor (pointing, waving), facial actions (tongue out, blowing), object actions (banging blocks, rolling ball).\n\nSTEP 8 - TEST FOR GENERALIZATION: Periodically introduce novel (untrained) actions to test for generalized imitation. If learner imitates without training, generalized imitation is emerging. If not, continue teaching more exemplars.\n\nSTEP 9 - VARY MODELS: Once established with primary instructor, vary who models. Include peers, parents, siblings. This promotes generalization across people.\n\nSTEP 10 - NATURAL MAINTENANCE: Once generalized imitation emerges, natural contingencies typically maintain it. Social environments naturally reinforce imitation (people respond positively when you copy their waves, dances, gestures).\n\nPROGRESSION OF DIFFICULTY:\n1. Simple, gross motor, discrete actions (clapping, stomping)\n2. Fine motor actions (pointing, finger movements)\n3. Facial actions (mouth open, tongue out)\n4. Actions with objects (rolling ball, stacking blocks)\n5. Multi-step action sequences (clap-then-wave)\n6. Novel, complex actions (dance moves, yoga poses)\n\nCOMMON CHALLENGES:\n\nATTENDING DEFICITS: Learner doesn't watch model. Solution: Teach attending first, use attention prompts, hold interesting items near face to draw attention.\n\nMOTOR LIMITATIONS: Learner cannot physically perform action. Solution: Assess motor abilities, adapt actions, use graduated approximations.\n\nPROMPT DEPENDENCY: Learner waits for prompts. Solution: Increase time delay, reduce prompt intensity gradually, reinforce independent responses more strongly.\n\nLIMITED GENERALIZATION: Learner only imitates taught actions. Solution: Teach more exemplars (15-20+), vary action types, introduce novelty gradually.\n\nTRANSFER TO VOCAL IMITATION:\nOnce motor imitation is established, use similar procedures for vocal imitation (echoic). The discriminative control established in motor imitation transfers to vocal modality with consistent training.`,

        title: 'Vocal Imitation (Echoic) Training',
        content: `Vocal imitation, or echoic behavior, is repeating vocal sounds immediately after a vocal model. It's foundational for language development.\n\nDEFINITION - ECHOIC:\nSkinner's analysis defines echoic as verbal behavior with point-to-point correspondence between the vocal stimulus (model's sound) and the vocal response (learner's sound). There is formal similarity - they sound alike. Example: Model says "ball," learner says "ball." The response matches the stimulus in form.\n\nIMPORTANCE FOR LANGUAGE:\nEchoic is critical for: acquiring new vocal responses, learning correct pronunciation, building phonemic repertoire, establishing articulation patterns, and accelerating language development. Most early language emerges from echoic - children echo parents' words then those words come under other sources of control (mands, tacts).\n\nPOINT-TO-POINT CORRESPONDENCE:\nEach part of the vocal model corresponds to part of the vocal response. If model says "ba-na-na" (three syllables), the response should have three corresponding parts. This correspondence distinguishes echoic from other verbal operants.\n\nDOES NOT REQUIRE COMPREHENSION:\nEchoic is pure imitation - the learner doesn't need to understand the word's meaning. You can echo words in foreign languages without knowing what they mean. This is powerful for teaching: can establish vocal responses first, then bring them under appropriate stimulus control for tacts, mands, intraverbals.\n\nTEACHING VOCAL IMITATION - PROCEDURES:\n\nPREREQUISITES: Attending to speaker's face, sitting appropriately, motor imitation established (helpful but not required), absence of competing vocal behavior.\n\nSTEP 1 - ASSESS CURRENT VOCAL REPERTOIRE: Determine what sounds/words learner already produces. Start training with sounds close to existing repertoire.\n\nSTEP 2 - BEGIN WITH EASY SOUNDS: Start with single vowels or consonant-vowel combinations (CV) that learner produces spontaneously: "ah," "ee," "ma," "ba." These are easiest to echo.\n\nSTEP 3 - PRESENT MODEL: Say sound clearly while learner attends. May need to draw attention to your mouth. Keep model brief and clear.\n\nSTEP 4 - PROMPT IF NEEDED: Prompts for echoic are challenging since you can't physically prompt vocal responses. Options: Verbal instructions ("Say 'ma'"), repeated models with emphasis, shaping from similar sounds learner makes, visual prompts (picture of mouth position), tactile prompts (touch throat to feel vibration).\n\nSTEP 5 - REINFORCE MATCHING: Reinforce any vocal response approximating the model initially. Use differential reinforcement to shape closer matches. Potent reinforcers needed early (food, preferred items) then fade to social reinforcement.\n\nSTEP 6 - SHAPING APPROXIMATIONS: Accept rough approximations initially. Model "ball," accept "ba" or "buh." Gradually require closer matches through differential reinforcement. This is classic shaping applied to vocal behavior.\n\nSTEP 7 - EXPAND SOUND REPERTOIRE: Once several sounds mastered, systematically teach new sounds. Progression: Vowels (a, e, i, o, u), Consonant-vowel (ba, da, ma), Vowel-consonant (am, in, up), Consonant-vowel-consonant (mom, dad, cat), Multi-syllable (baby, mommy, water), Words, Phrases.\n\nSTEP 8 - VARY VOCAL MODELS: Include different speakers (vary voice pitch, speed). This promotes generalization.\n\nSTEP 9 - REDUCE TIME DELAY: Initially, model is immediate. Gradually increase delay between model and opportunity to respond (up to 1-2 seconds). This maintains attention and control.\n\nSTEP 10 - TRANSFER TO OTHER OPERANTS: Once echoic established, transfer vocal responses to other verbal operants. A word learned echoically can become a mand (requesting), tact (labeling), or intraverbal (conversational).\n\nPROGRESSION:\n1. Single vowels (2-5 sounds)\n2. CV combinations (5-10 sounds)\n3. VC combinations (5-10 sounds)  \n4. CVC words (10-20 words)\n5. Multi-syllable words (20-50 words)\n6. Short phrases (2-3 words)\n7. Longer phrases/sentences\n\nCOMMON CHALLENGES:\n\nNO VOCAL BEHAVIOR: Learner is non-vocal. Solution: Establish any vocal behavior first through reinforcement, shaping from any sounds made. May need AAC (augmentative communication) concurrently.\n\nSTIMULUS OVERSELECTIVITY: Learner attends to irrelevant aspects (hand gestures, not sounds). Solution: Present model from behind screen, vary irrelevant features, explicitly prompt attending to sounds.\n\nAPROXIA/ARTICULATION DISORDERS: Learner cannot produce sounds due to motor speech disorders. Solution: Collaborate with SLP, modify sounds selected, use AAC if needed.\n\nECHOLALIA (OVERUSE OF ECHOIC): Learner echoes everything but language isn't functional. Solution: Establish stimulus control - only reinforce echoic to specific SD ("Say ___"), strengthen other verbal operants (mands, tacts, intraverbals) so echoic isn't only language mode.\n\nTRANSFER OF STIMULUS CONTROL:\nThe ultimate goal isn't echoic itself, but using echoic to establish vocal responses that can transfer to functional language. Teach "cookie" echoically, then transfer to mand (requesting cookie when hungry) and tact (labeling cookie when seen). This transfer is accomplished through simultaneous presentation then fading the vocal model while strengthening the functional stimulus control.`,

        id: 'intervention-6',
        title: 'Self-Management Procedures',
        content: `Self-management involves individuals manipulating environmental variables to change their own behavior. The person becomes their own behavior change agent.\n\nDEFINITION AND OVERVIEW:\nSelf-management occurs when a person engages in behavior (the "controlling behavior") at one time to alter variables affecting another behavior (the "controlled behavior") at a later time. Example: Setting an alarm Sunday night (controlling behavior) to ensure waking early Monday (controlled behavior). The individual arranges antecedents, monitors performance, and delivers consequences to themselves.\n\nKEY SELF-MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS:\n\n1. SELF-MONITORING (SELF-OBSERVATION):\nSystematically observing and recording one's own behavior. The individual serves as their own data collector. Methods include: tally counters, data sheets, mobile apps, journals, wearable devices tracking steps/exercise.\n\nREACTIVITY: The process of self-monitoring often changes the behavior being monitored. Simply counting food intake reduces eating. Tracking exercise increases exercise. This reactivity can be therapeutic when change is desired. Reactivity is stronger when: behavior is socially significant, monitoring is conspicuous/public, person is motivated to change, goals are set alongside monitoring.\n\nSELF-MONITORING PROCEDURES: Define behavior operationally, select recording method (frequency, duration), cue monitoring (timers, reminders), record immediately when behavior occurs or on a schedule, graph or review data regularly.\n\n2. SELF-EVALUATION (SELF-ASSESSMENT):\nComparing one's performance to a criterion or goal. After self-monitoring, the person judges: "Did I meet my goal?" "Was my performance acceptable?" This comparison provides feedback.\n\nSelf-evaluation requires: establishing a clear criterion (walk 10,000 steps, study 2 hours), self-monitoring actual performance, comparing actual to criterion, making evaluative judgment (met goal yes/no, exceeded/fell short).\n\nAccuracy of self-evaluation can be taught. Initially, provide external feedback to calibrate self-assessment. Reinforce accurate self-evaluation. Fade external verification as accuracy improves.\n\n3. SELF-REINFORCEMENT:\nThe individual arranges contingencies and delivers consequences to themselves based on their behavior. The person controls access to the reinforcer and delivers it contingent on meeting criteria.\n\nExample: "If I complete my work by 5pm, I'll watch my favorite show." "After exercising 30 minutes, I'll have dessert." The individual must have control over the reinforcer - can't "cheat" easily.\n\nEffectiveness depends on: Access control (person truly controls reinforcer availability), Accurate self-monitoring (can't reinforce if don't know behavior occurred), Meaningful reinforcers (must be something person values), Following the contingency (not taking reinforcer without meeting criterion).\n\nSelf-reinforcement is most effective when combined with self-monitoring and self-evaluation. The chain: Monitor behavior → Evaluate against criterion → Deliver reinforcement if met.\n\n4. GOAL-SETTING:\nEstablishing performance criteria for behavior. Effective goals are: Specific (study 2 hours, not "study more"), Measurable (can quantify), Achievable but challenging (stretch but attainable), Time-bound (by Friday, this week), Written and visible (posted, tracked).\n\nGoal-setting increases behavior by: Making expectations clear, Providing standard for self-evaluation, Increasing commitment, Creating motivation, Allowing progress tracking.\n\nGoals should be: Short-term and long-term (daily, weekly, monthly goals leading to ultimate goal), Adjustable based on performance (if too easy/hard, modify), Accompanied by action plans (how will you achieve goal).\n\n5. STIMULUS CONTROL FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT:\nArranging antecedents to prompt desired behavior or prevent problem behavior.\n\nEXAMPLES: Posting reminder signs ("Remember to floss" on bathroom mirror), Setting calendar alerts for medication, Removing junk food from home to reduce eating, Studying in library (stimulus control for studying) not bedroom (SD for sleeping), Laying out workout clothes night before to prompt morning exercise.\n\nPrinciple: Manipulate environmental stimuli to make desired behavior more likely and undesired behavior less likely. Control your environment to control your behavior.\n\n6. SELF-INSTRUCTION:\nProviding verbal prompts to oneself to guide behavior. Internal or external self-talk describing what to do.\n\nEXAMPLES: Athlete saying "Watch the ball" during game, Student saying "First I need to read the question carefully," Person telling themselves "I can do this" when anxious.\n\nSelf-instruction taught through: Model self-instruction aloud, Have learner repeat instructions aloud, Fade to whispering, Fade to covert (thinking), Practice until automatic.\n\nPARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR: Problem-solving tasks, Multi-step procedures, Emotional regulation, Maintaining focus.\n\nCOMBINING SELF-MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES:\nMost effective self-management programs combine multiple procedures:\n\nEXAMPLE - EXERCISE PROGRAM:\n1. Goal-setting: "Exercise 30 minutes, 5 days/week"\n2. Stimulus control: Lay out clothes night before, set alarm\n3. Self-monitoring: Track each workout in app\n4. Self-evaluation: Weekly review - "Did I meet 5-day goal?"\n5. Self-reinforcement: If goal met, movie night Friday\n6. Self-instruction: During workout, "You can do 5 more reps"\n\nTEACHING SELF-MANAGEMENT:\nSelf-management skills must be taught. Most people don't spontaneously implement effective self-management. Teaching involves: Rationale (explain why self-management helps), Model procedures (demonstrate monitoring, evaluation), Guided practice (supervise initial implementation), Feedback (correct errors, reinforce accurate application), Fade support (gradually reduce external oversight), Maintain (booster sessions, check-ins).\n\nBENEFITS OF SELF-MANAGEMENT:\n- Promotes independence and autonomy\n- Reduces need for external monitors\n- Increases generalization (takes skills everywhere)\n- Enhances maintenance (individual continues procedures after training)\n- Builds self-efficacy and personal control\n- Applicable to wide range of behaviors and settings\n\nLIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES:\n- Requires honesty/integrity (can cheat self-monitoring)\n- Can be effortful (takes time and attention)\n- May need initial external support to establish\n- Less effective with immediate gratification behaviors\n- Accuracy may drift over time without checks\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nEnsure individual freely chooses goals, not imposed by others. Self-management should increase personal freedom, not external control disguised as self-control. Goals should align with individual's values and preferences.`,

// Add Contingency Contracting topic to Intervention
if (interventionCategory) {
    interventionCategory.topics.push({
        id: 'intervention-7',
        title: 'Contingency Contracting',
        content: `A contingency contract (behavioral contract) is a written document specifying the relationship between behaviors and consequences. It makes contingencies explicit and public.\n\nDEFINITION:\nA contingency contract is a written (sometimes verbal but preferably written) agreement that specifies: Target behavior(s) to be performed, Consequences for performing (or not performing) the behavior, Criteria for success (how much, how often, how well), Timeline (when contract is in effect, deadlines), Parties involved (who does what), Signatures (commitment from all parties).\n\nESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE CONTRACTS:\n\n1. SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS: Operationally defined, observable, measurable. Not "be good" but "complete homework assignments, turn in on time."\n\n2. CLEAR CRITERIA: How much? How often? To what standard? "Complete all homework daily for 5 consecutive school days."\n\n3. CONSEQUENCES SPECIFIED: What happens if criterion met? What if not met? "If criterion met: 2 hours video game time Friday. If not met: No video games this weekend."\n\n4. POSITIVE FOCUS: Emphasize earning rewards for desired behavior rather than avoiding punishment. Frame as "earning" not "avoiding loss."\n\n5. FAIR AND ACHIEVABLE: Criteria should be challenging but attainable. Reinforcement proportional to effort required.\n\n6. TIMELINE: Specific dates - when does contract begin, when does performance period end, when are consequences delivered?\n\n7. BONUS CLAUSE (OPTIONAL): Extra reinforcement for exceeding criteria. Motivates going beyond minimum.\n\n8. SIGNATURES: All parties sign, indicating understanding and agreement. Creates commitment.\n\nEXAMPLE CONTRACT:\n"I, [Student], agree to: Complete all assigned homework and turn it in on time every day for one week (Monday-Friday, October 15-19). If I meet this goal: I will earn 2 hours of video game time on Friday evening plus choice of dinner on Saturday. If I exceed this goal (complete homework early/extra credit): Bonus - movie theater trip on Saturday. If I do not meet this goal: No video game time this weekend, but I can try again next week. Signed: [Student], [Parent], [Teacher]. Date: October 14, 2025."\n\nDESIGNING EFFECTIVE CONTRACTS:\n\nNEGOTIATION: Contract should be collaboratively developed, not imposed. All parties have input. Individual whose behavior is targeted should participate in goal-setting and reinforcer selection. This increases buy-in and commitment.\n\nFAIRNESS: Balance between effort required and reinforcement earned. "The punishment should fit the crime" - the reward should fit the work. If task is difficult, reinforcement should be valuable.\n\nCLARITY: Language should be clear, specific, and understandable to all parties. Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms. Include examples if needed.\n\nREINFORCEMENT-FOCUSED: Emphasize positive consequences for meeting criteria rather than punishment for failing. Phrase as "You will earn..." not "You will avoid losing..."\n\nIMPLEMENTING CONTRACTS:\n\n1. REVIEW CONTRACT: Ensure all parties understand terms. Read aloud together. Answer questions.\n\n2. POST PUBLICLY: Display contract where visible. Increases awareness and commitment.\n\n3. MONITOR PERFORMANCE: Track behavior specified. Use data collection. Share data with individual regularly.\n\n4. PROVIDE FEEDBACK: Frequent check-ins on progress. "You've completed homework 3 out of 3 days so far - keep it up!"\n5. DELIVER CONSEQUENCES: Follow through consistently. If criterion met, deliver reinforcement immediately/as specified. If not met, withhold reinforcement but provide encouragement for next attempt.\n\n6. REVIEW AND REVISE: If contract isn't working (criteria too hard/easy, reinforcement not motivating), renegotiate. Contracts can and should be revised.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n- Makes contingencies explicit (no confusion about expectations)\n- Creates public commitment (harder to back out)\n- Reduces disputes (terms are written, agreed-upon)\n- Increases motivation (clear goal and reward)\n- Teaches responsibility and self-management\n- Applicable to many settings (home, school, work)\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS:\n\nRIGIDITY: Written contract might feel inflexible. Solution: Include clause allowing renegotiation, build in flexibility.\n\nFAILURE TO FOLLOW THROUGH: Adults don't deliver promised consequences. Solution: Select realistic reinforcers adults can reliably provide.\n\nEXTERNAL REINFORCEMENT DEPENDENCY: Individual only performs behavior for external rewards. Solution: Plan for fading external reinforcement to natural contingencies over time.\n\nCONFLICT OVER TERMS: Disagreement about whether criterion met. Solution: Ensure operational definitions, use objective data, specify who makes final determination.\n\nCONTRACTS IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS:\n\nHOME: Parents and children (chores for allowance, homework for privileges).\n\nSCHOOL: Teacher and student (behavior goals for rewards), IEP team and student (academic goals for privileges).\n\nWORK: Employer and employee (performance goals for bonuses/promotion).\n\nCLINICAL: Therapist and client (treatment participation for agreed-upon goals), Substance abuse programs (clean drug tests for privileges).\n\nFADING CONTRACTS:\nGoal is often for behavior to come under natural contingencies rather than depend on contracts indefinitely. Fading process: Lengthen performance period (daily → weekly → monthly), Reduce reinforcement magnitude/frequency (thin schedule), Shift to natural reinforcers (external reward → social praise → intrinsic satisfaction), Eventually discontinue formal contract while maintaining behavior.\n\nETHICS:\nContracts should be fair, not coercive. Individual should have genuine choice to participate. Power differentials (teacher-student, parent-child) require sensitivity - ensure child has voice. Consequences should never include removal of basic needs/rights (food, safety, dignity).`,

        title: 'Graph Construction and Visual Analysis',
        content: `Graphical display of data is essential in behavior analysis. Proper graph construction and visual analysis enable data-based decision making.\n\nPURPOSE OF GRAPHS:\nGraphs provide visual representation of behavior over time. They allow: Detection of patterns and trends, Comparison across conditions/phases, Communication of results to stakeholders, Identification of variability, Evaluation of intervention effects.\n\nSTANDARD COMPONENTS OF BEHAVIOR GRAPHS:\n\n1. AXES:\nX-AXIS (horizontal): Represents time - sessions, days, weeks, observation periods. Time progresses left to right. Should be labeled with units (Sessions, Days, Weeks, Dates).\n\nY-AXIS (vertical): Represents the dependent variable - the behavior being measured. Units depend on measurement system: frequency (count), rate (count/time), duration (seconds/minutes), percentage (%). Should be labeled with dimension and units (e.g., "Frequency of Hand-Raising" or "Duration of On-Task Behavior (minutes)").\n\n2. SCALE:\nY-axis scale selection is critical. Generally should start at zero to show true proportions. Exception: When behavior never approaches zero and small changes are important, can use truncated scale WITH scale break symbol (wavy line) indicating discontinuity.\n\nScale should display data clearly without visual distortion. Too small a scale compresses data (can't see changes); too large exaggerates changes.\n\n3. DATA POINTS:\nPlot each data point where the x-value (time) and y-value (behavior) intersect. Data points often marked with symbols (circles, squares, triangles) when multiple data series displayed.\n\n4. DATA PATH:\nConnect data points WITHIN phases with solid lines. Do NOT connect across phase change lines. The data path shows the pattern/trend within each condition. If sessions are missed (gaps in time), either leave gap in line or use dashed line to indicate discontinuity.\n\n5. PHASE CHANGE LINES:\nVertical lines separating different conditions/phases. Usually dashed or solid vertical lines. Clearly delineate when conditions changed (baseline, intervention, return to baseline). Each phase should be labeled at top or bottom (BL, INT, BL, INT-2).\n\n6. PHASE LABELS:\nLabel each phase/condition. Examples: Baseline, Intervention, Treatment, Return to Baseline, Maintenance, Generalization. Labels should be brief but clear.\n\n7. FIGURE CAPTION/TITLE:\nDescribe what the graph shows. Include: dependent variable, independent variable (intervention), participant/setting if relevant. Should be self-explanatory - someone unfamiliar with study should understand from caption.\n\n8. LEGEND (if needed):\nWhen multiple data series on one graph, include legend explaining what each symbol/line represents.\n\nCONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:\n\n- X-axis typically 1.5-2 times wider than Y-axis (allows comfortable viewing)\n- Use graph paper or software (Excel, GraphPad, specialized behavior analysis software)\n- Plot data immediately after collection (timely for decision-making)\n- Keep graphs neat, legible, professional\n- Follow APA style for publications\n\nVISUAL ANALYSIS:\nVisual analysis is examining graphed data to determine if meaningful behavior change occurred. Six characteristics analyzed:\n\n1. LEVEL: The value (mean/average) of data within a condition. When analyzing level, calculate mean of baseline phase and mean of intervention phase. Compare - did average level change?\n\nEXAMPLE: Baseline mean = 3 instances of problem behavior. Intervention mean = 1 instance. Level decreased by 2 instances on average.\n\n2. TREND: The direction (slope) of the data path. Three types: Increasing (upward slope - behavior increasing), Decreasing (downward slope - behavior decreasing), Flat/Zero (no slope - behavior stable).\n\nTrend analyzed within phases and compared across phases. Desired trend depends on behavior: Want increasing trend for skill acquisition, decreasing trend for problem behavior reduction.\n\n3. VARIABILITY: The degree of fluctuation/bounce in data. High variability = data points scattered, inconsistent. Low variability = data points clustered tightly, stable.\n\nHigh variability makes detecting change difficult. Stable data (low variability) provides clearer baseline for comparison. Address variability through: Improved measurement consistency, Controlling extraneous variables, More sessions to detect patterns through noise.\n\n4. IMMEDIACY OF EFFECT: How quickly behavior changes after intervention introduced. Immediate change (data shifts right at phase change) suggests strong treatment effect. Delayed change (gradual shift after several sessions) may indicate treatment effect but slower.\n\n5. OVERLAP: The proportion of data points from one phase that fall within the range of data from another phase. HIGH OVERLAP: Intervention data within baseline range (weak effect). LOW/NO OVERLAP: Clear separation between phases (strong effect).\n\nCalculate percentage of non-overlapping data (PND) - percentage of intervention points exceeding the highest baseline point (for behavior increase) or below lowest baseline point (for behavior decrease). PND >90% = highly effective, 70-90% = effective, <70% = questionable.\n\n6. CONSISTENCY ACROSS PHASES: In designs with replication (ABAB, multiple baseline), do effects replicate? When intervention introduced multiple times, does behavior change consistently each time? Consistent patterns across replications strengthen demonstration of control.\n\nDECISION MAKING FROM VISUAL ANALYSIS:\nBased on analysis, make decisions: Continue current phase (need more data points, pattern unclear), Change phases (clear effect demonstrated or clearly not working), Modify intervention (effect present but insufficient), Return to baseline (test reversibility), Generalization probes (extend to new settings/behaviors).\n\nCOMMON GRAPHING ERRORS:\n- Connecting data across phase lines\n- Not labeling axes\n- Scale doesn't start at zero without indicating break\n- Too much data on one graph (cluttered)\n- Missing phase labels\n- Graph not self-explanatory\n\nGRAPHS FOR DIFFERENT DESIGNS:\nABAB/REVERSAL: One graph with phases separated by vertical lines.\nMULTIPLE BASELINE: Stacked graphs (tier graphs) - each behavior/setting/participant on separate tier, vertically aligned by time.\nCHANGING CRITERION: One graph with horizontal lines indicating criterion levels for each phase.\nALTERNATING TREATMENTS: One graph with different symbols for each treatment condition.`,

        title: 'Schedules of Reinforcement',
        content: `A schedule of reinforcement specifies which occurrences of a behavior will be reinforced. Different schedules produce different patterns and rates of responding.\n\nCONTINUOUS REINFORCEMENT (CRF):\nEvery occurrence of the behavior is reinforced. Used during initial acquisition of new behaviors. Produces rapid learning but behavior extinguishes quickly if reinforcement stops. Example: Reinforcing every correct response when first teaching a skill.\n\nINTERMITTENT (PARTIAL) REINFORCEMENT:\nOnly some occurrences reinforced. Four basic types based on two dimensions: Fixed vs Variable (predictable vs unpredictable) and Ratio vs Interval (number of responses vs time passage).\n\nFIXED RATIO (FR): Reinforcement after a fixed number of responses. FR5 = reinforcement after every 5 responses. Produces high, steady response rate with brief pause after reinforcement (post-reinforcement pause). Example: Piece-rate pay (paid per 10 items completed).\n\nVARIABLE RATIO (VR): Reinforcement after average number of responses, but number varies unpredictably. VR5 = average of 5 responses (might be 3, then 7, then 4, then 6). Produces highest, most steady response rate with no pausing. Very resistant to extinction. Example: Gambling/slot machines (win after unpredictable number of plays).\n\nFIXED INTERVAL (FI): Reinforcement for first response after a fixed time interval. FI 2-min = first response after 2 minutes is reinforced. Produces "scalloped" pattern - low rate after reinforcement, increasing as interval ends. Example: Checking email (first check after messages arrive is "reinforced").\n\nVARIABLE INTERVAL (VI): Reinforcement for first response after variable time intervals. VI 2-min = intervals average 2 minutes but vary (1 min, 3 min, 2 min). Produces moderate, steady response rate. Example: Fishing (catch fish after unpredictable time).\n\nCHOOSING SCHEDULES:\nAcquisition: Use CRF (continuous). Maintenance: Thin to intermittent (variable schedules maintain best). Variable schedules (VR, VI) create strongest, most persistent behavior and greatest resistance to extinction.\n\nCOMPLEX SCHEDULES:\nConcurrent (two schedules available simultaneously), Multiple (two or more schedules alternating with discriminative stimuli), Mixed (schedules alternate without SD), Chained (completion of one schedule's requirement produces SD for next schedule), Tandem (like chained but without discriminative stimuli), Progressive ratio (ratio requirement increases after each reinforcer).`,

        title: 'Token Economy',
        content: `A token economy is a structured reinforcement system where individuals earn tokens (conditioned reinforcers) for desired behaviors, then exchange tokens for backup reinforcers.\n\nCOMPONENTS:\nTokens are tangible items (poker chips, stickers, points, checkmarks) that function as conditioned reinforcers. They're paired with backup reinforcers - items or activities tokens can be exchanged for. Exchange rate specifies how many tokens needed for each backup reinforcer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\nTokens bridge delay between behavior and backup reinforcer. Can deliver immediately even when backup not available. Tokens don't satiate like consumables. Can individualize backup reinforcers to preferences. Teaches delayed gratification. Reduces disruption (quick token delivery vs stopping for primary reinforcer).\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n1. Define target behaviors operationally\n2. Select token type (physical, visual, electronic)\n3. Identify backup reinforcers (menu of options, varied preferences)\n4. Establish exchange rate (balance work required with reward value)\n5. Teach system (explain rules, model earning/exchange)\n6. Deliver tokens immediately contingent on behavior\n7. Allow regular exchange opportunities (initially frequent, then less)\n8. Monitor and revise (adjust rates, add/remove backups based on effectiveness)\n\nRESPONSE COST:\nCan include losing tokens for problem behavior (response cost - a type of negative punishment). If used, clearly specify which behaviors result in token loss and how many lost.\n\nFADING TOKEN ECONOMIES:\nEventually fade to natural contingencies. Gradual process: Increase token requirements, Decrease backup reinforcer value, Lengthen exchange periods, Fade to more natural token systems (money, grades), Eventually discontinue while maintaining behavior through natural reinforcement.\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\nClassrooms (students earn points for academic work/behavior), Psychiatric units (patients earn privileges), Correctional facilities (inmates earn privileges), Home (children earn tokens for chores/homework), Group homes, Treatment programs.`,
