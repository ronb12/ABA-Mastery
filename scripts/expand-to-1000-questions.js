Inconsistent implementation leads to: unclear functional relationships, slower progress, confusion for learner, inability to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Treatment integrity (fidelity) should be monitored through: direct observation, procedural checklists, permanent products, regular training refreshers. High integrity (>80-90%) essential for valid intervention evaluation. Least restrictive effective approaches preferred. Baseline data required before intervention.

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: `Effective ${topic} requires teaching to mastery PLUS explicit generalization programming. Research consistently shows: multiple exemplar training (teaching sufficient examples across varied stimuli, settings, people) produces generalization. Programming for maintenance through intermittent reinforcement schedules, natural reinforcers, and distributed practice. Skills taught in isolation often fail to generalize or maintain. Massed practice without variety limits transfer. Continuous reinforcement creates dependency. Best practice: teach sufficient exemplars, vary teaching contexts, thin reinforcement to natural rates, program for generalization from the start, conduct generalization probes, provide booster sessions.`,

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: `Best practice in ${topic} involves using MULTIPLE assessment methods for convergent validity. Triangulation of data sources increases confidence in identified function or assessment results. Multiple methods include: indirect assessment (interviews, rating scales) for historical information and hypotheses, descriptive assessment (ABC data, scatterplots) for observational patterns in natural context, experimental functional analysis for causal demonstration when needed. Convergence of evidence across methods provides strongest basis for intervention. Single method has limitations. Assessment should always precede intervention.

Core principles include: acting in client's best interest, maintaining professional competence and boundaries, obtaining informed consent, protecting confidentiality with limited exceptions (mandated reporting, danger), avoiding exploitation or harm, practicing within scope of competence, appropriate documentation for accountability and continuity of care.

Each measurement system has optimal applications: Frequency/rate for discrete behaviors, Duration for continuous behaviors or temporal extent, Latency for response time, Interval recording for estimation when continuous recording impractical, Permanent product when behavior leaves lasting evidence. Selection based on: behavior characteristics (discrete vs continuous, frequency, duration), practical constraints (observer availability, setting demands), treatment goals (what dimension matters most).

Mands controlled by establishing operations (motivation) and reinforced by specific consequences requested. Tacts controlled by nonverbal discriminative stimuli and reinforced by generalized social reinforcement. Echoics controlled by verbal models with point-to-point correspondence. Intraverbals controlled by prior verbal behavior without correspondence. Listener behavior controlled by verbal stimuli from others.
