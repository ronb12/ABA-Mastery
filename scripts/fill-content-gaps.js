        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "LEVEL refers to the value (mean/average) of data within a condition or phase. It represents where the data points fall on the y-axis. When analyzing level, compare the mean of baseline to the mean of intervention. Changes in level (vertical distance between phase means) indicate treatment effects.

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "OVERLAP examines the proportion of data points from one phase that fall within the range of data from another phase. High overlap suggests weak treatment effect (intervention data overlaps with baseline range). Low/no overlap suggests strong effect (clear separation between conditions). This is a key component of visual analysis that complements level, trend, and variability assessment.",

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "MULTIPLE BASELINE ACROSS BEHAVIORS demonstrates experimental control by sequentially introducing intervention to different behaviors while others remain at baseline. When intervention is applied to Behavior 1, only that behavior changes while Behaviors 2 and 3 stay at baseline. This shows control WITHOUT withdrawing intervention (unlike ABAB reversal).

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "CHANGING CRITERION design demonstrates control when behavior systematically MATCHES or closely tracks each successive criterion change. As criterion is increased (or decreased), behavior follows. Each criterion change is a mini-experiment showing behavior responds to the contingency. Used for behaviors that can be gradually shaped (e.g., reducing smoking from 20â†’15â†’10â†’5 cigarettes/day). Behavior tracking criterion = experimental control.",

        explanation: "REACTIVITY is behavior change caused by self-monitoring itself, independent of other interventions. Simply measuring your behavior changes it. Example: Self-recording food intake reduces eating even without other interventions. Can be therapeutic (if change is desired) or problematic for research (measurement affects behavior). Typically fades over time. More reactive when: behavior is socially significant, monitoring is conspicuous, motivation is high, goals are set.",

        explanation: "SELF-DELIVERED REINFORCEMENT (self-reinforcement) is the individual arranging contingencies and delivering consequences to themselves. Person controls access to reinforcer and delivers it contingent on meeting criterion. Example: 'If I study 2 hours, I'll watch my favorite show.' Effectiveness depends on: access control (can't 'cheat'), accurate self-monitoring, meaningful reinforcers, and initial external support/training. More likely to work when combined with self-monitoring and self-evaluation.",

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "X-AXIS (horizontal axis) represents TIME - sessions, days, weeks, or observation periods. Time moves left to right. Y-AXIS (vertical) represents the DEPENDENT VARIABLE - the behavior being measured (frequency, duration, percentage, etc.). This is standard convention in behavior analysis. Phase lines separate conditions (baseline, intervention). Data points plotted where time (x) and behavior value (y) intersect. Proper axes labeling is essential for interpretation.",

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "PHASE CHANGE LINES are VERTICAL dashed or solid lines separating different conditions/phases (baseline, intervention, return to baseline). They visually demarcate when conditions changed. Should be labeled (BL, Intervention, BL, etc.). Critical for visual analysis - allows comparison between phases. Never connect data points across phase lines (each phase is separate condition). Proper phase lines improve graph clarity and interpretation.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "DATA POINTS are connected with solid lines ONLY WITHIN phases, NOT across phase change lines. Each phase represents different condition - connecting across phases implies continuity that doesn't exist. Within-phase connections show data path (trend). If data are missing (session skipped), gap in line or dashed connection can indicate discontinuity. Proper connection practice aids visual analysis of trends within each condition.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Y-AXIS scale should be selected to display data CLEARLY while avoiding DISTORTION. Generally start at zero (shows true proportions), but exceptions exist when: behavior never approaches zero, small changes are important, or zero start compresses data. Truncated y-axis (not starting at zero) can exaggerate effects visually. Include scale break symbol if truncated. Key: Present data accurately without misleading.
