    question: "When implementing a DRA procedure to reduce hand-flapping, which replacement behavior would be MOST appropriate if the function is automatic reinforcement?",
    options: [
      "Asking for attention when hand-flapping begins",
      "Providing alternative sensory input (fidget toy, stress ball)",
      "Time-out when hand-flapping occurs",
      "Ignoring all hand-flapping"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "For automatically-reinforced behaviors (maintained by sensory stimulation), provide functionally equivalent ALTERNATIVE sensory input. The replacement must produce similar sensory consequences. A fidget toy can provide tactile/proprioceptive input replacing hand-flapping. Asking for attention addresses social function (incorrect). Time-out is punishment. Ignoring (extinction) doesn't provide alternative sensory input. Match the sensory quality the behavior produces.",

    question: "A BCBA is implementing DRL for a student who calls out in class 40 times per hour. After one week at criterion of 35 or fewer, the student consistently meets this criterion. What should the BCBA do next?",
    options: [
      "Maintain the criterion at 35 indefinitely",
      "Gradually lower the criterion to 30 or fewer per hour",
      "Switch to extinction",
      "Increase the criterion to 40 to make it easier"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "DRL uses PROGRESSIVE CRITERION TIGHTENING. Once the student consistently meets current criterion (35/hour), gradually reduce it toward the terminal goal (normal/acceptable rate). Typical progression: 40â†’35â†’30â†’25â†’20 until reaching appropriate level. Maintaining at 35 doesn't continue improvement. Extinction might be too abrupt.

      "A secondary reinforcer used when tokens run out",
      "The actual reinforcers that tokens are exchanged for",
      "An emergency reinforcer for severe behaviors"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "BACKUP REINFORCERS are the actual items/activities that tokens are EXCHANGED for (prizes, privileges, activities). Tokens are conditioned reinforcers that bridge to backups. The tokens have value ONLY because they can be exchanged. Examples: 10 tokens = iPad time, 5 tokens = snack, 20 tokens = toy. Variety of backup reinforcers maintains token value and prevents satiation. Must be desirable to individual.",

      "Give tokens randomly",
      "Remove all backup reinforcers first"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "SYSTEMATIC FADING of token systems involves gradually INCREASING the exchange ratio (schedule thinning). Start: 5 tokens = reinforcer. Gradually: 10 tokens = reinforcer, then 20 tokens, etc. Simultaneously, increase intervals between token delivery. Eventually fade to natural contingencies. Abrupt removal causes behavior deterioration. Random delivery is inconsistent. Removing backups eliminates token value. Gradual thinning maintains behavior while reducing artificial system.",

      "On a time-based schedule regardless of behavior",
      "Only when appropriate behavior occurs",
      "Randomly without any schedule"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "NCR delivers the maintaining reinforcer on a TIME-BASED schedule (FT or VT) INDEPENDENT of behavior. Example: Attention every 2 minutes whether or not problem behavior occurs. This is an ABOLISHING OPERATION - frequent 'free' access reduces reinforcer value, reducing motivation for problem behavior. Not random - systematic schedule. Effective for attention-maintained and tangible-maintained behaviors. Gradually thin schedule as behavior reduces.",

    question: "A student engages in aggression to escape difficult math tasks. FCT has been implemented with a 'break' card. Initially, every card request resulted in a break. Now the BCBA wants to thin the schedule. What should be done FIRST?",

      "Stop responding to card requests entirely",
      "Increase the number of card requests needed before providing break",
      "Add a brief delay before providing break after card request",
      "Remove the card and use verbal requests only"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "SCHEDULE THINNING for FCT starts with ADDING BRIEF DELAYS before reinforcement (delay tolerance). Start with immediate response, then add 5-second delay, gradually increase to 10, 20, 30 seconds, etc. This teaches delay tolerance before thinning response requirements. Next step would be multiple responses (2 requests for break). Abrupt removal causes extinction burst. Increasing requirements immediately is too difficult. Format change (card to verbal) is separate from schedule thinning.",

      "Avoiding difficult requests entirely"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "HIGH-PROBABILITY (HIGH-P) REQUEST SEQUENCES present several EASY requests (high probability of compliance) in rapid succession, then embed the DIFFICULT request (low-prob). Momentum from complying with easy requests increases likelihood of complying with difficult one. Example: 'Touch nose' (easy), 'Clap hands' (easy), 'Stand up' (easy), 'Complete worksheet' (difficult). Establish behavioral momentum, then capitalize on it. Increases compliance without coercion.",

      "Extinction"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "RESPONSE BLOCKING is EXTINCTION - physically preventing a response from producing its maintaining consequence. Example: Blocking hand from reaching face prevents self-injury from producing automatic reinforcement. The behavior occurs but doesn't produce the typical sensory consequence. Not punishment (doesn't add aversive or remove reinforcer contingent on behavior). Not reinforcement. Pure extinction through response prevention. Expect extinction burst and spontaneous recovery.",

      "Providing additional reinforcement"

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "OVERCORRECTION is positive punishment requiring EFFORTFUL behavior contingent on problem behavior. Two types: (1) RESTITUTIONAL - restore environment to better-than-before (spill water â†’ clean entire kitchen). (2) POSITIVE PRACTICE - repeatedly practice correct form (hit someone â†’ practice gentle touching 10 times). Effort/duration makes it aversive. Teaches correct behavior while punishing incorrect.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "MATCHING LAW (Herrnstein, 1961) states that organisms allocate responding between alternatives proportional to reinforcement rates from those alternatives. If Alternative A provides 75% of reinforcement and Alternative B provides 25%, individual will allocate ~75% responses to A and ~25% to B. Application: If problem behavior produces more/faster reinforcement than appropriate behavior, problem behavior will dominate. Solution: Ensure appropriate behavior produces equal or greater reinforcement than problem behavior.",
