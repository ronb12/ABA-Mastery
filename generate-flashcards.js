// BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLES (80 flashcards)
const behavioralPrinciples = [
  ['reinforcement', 'What is differential reinforcement?', 'Reinforcing one response class while withholding reinforcement for another response class. Foundation of all behavior change procedures.'],
  ['reinforcement', 'What is deprivation?', 'A motivating operation that increases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and increases behavior that has produced that stimulus. Example: food deprivation increases food reinforcing value.'],
  ['reinforcement', 'What is satiation?', 'A motivating operation that decreases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and decreases behavior that has produced that stimulus. Example: eating to fullness decreases food value.'],
  ['reinforcement', 'What is a backup reinforcer?', 'In a token economy, the items or activities that tokens can be exchanged for. Example: toys, snacks, privileges.'],
  ['reinforcement', 'What is the matching law?', 'The principle that the relative rate of responding matches the relative rate of reinforcement. Allocation of behavior matches allocation of reinforcement.'],
  ['extinction', 'What is extinction-induced variability?', 'During extinction, behavior becomes more variable as the organism tries different response variations seeking reinforcement.'],
  ['extinction', 'What is resurgence?', 'Reappearance of previously effective behavior when current behavior is placed on extinction. Old behaviors come back when new ones stop working.'],
  ['extinction', 'What is behavioral momentum?', 'Resistance to change in behavior - more reinforcement history creates greater momentum. Like physical momentum, heavily reinforced behaviors resist disruption.'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is stimulus overselectivity?', 'Responding to a limited number of stimulus features while ignoring others. Common in autism - may only attend to one irrelevant feature.'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is a feature stimulus class?', 'Stimuli that share common physical features. Example: all red objects, all round shapes.'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is an arbitrary stimulus class?', 'Stimuli grouped together by arbitrary rules or human convention. Example: vehicles (car, truck, boat - look different but same class).'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is concept formation?', 'Discriminating all instances from all non-instances of a stimulus class. Requires both positive examples and non-examples.'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is blocking?', 'When prior conditioning prevents conditioning to a new stimulus presented in compound with already-conditioned stimulus. Previously learned association blocks new learning.'],
  ['stimulus-control', 'What is overshadowing?', 'When one element of a compound stimulus acquires more control than another element. More salient stimulus overshadows less salient one.'],
  ['motivation', 'What is a motivating operation (MO)?', 'Environmental variable that alters the reinforcing or punishing effectiveness of a stimulus and alters frequency of behavior that has produced that stimulus.'],
  ['motivation', 'What is an establishing operation (EO)?', 'MO that increases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and increases behavior that produces it. Example: deprivation increases value.'],
  ['motivation', 'What is an abolishing operation (AO)?', 'MO that decreases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and decreases behavior that produces it. Example: satiation decreases value.'],
  ['motivation', 'What is an unconditioned motivating operation (UMO)?', 'MO that functions without prior learning. Example: food deprivation, temperature extremes, painful stimulation.'],
  ['motivation', 'What is a conditioned motivating operation (CMO)?', 'MO that acquires its function through learning experiences. Types: CMO-S (surrogate), CMO-R (reflexive), CMO-T (transitive).'],
  ['motivation', 'What is a CMO-S (surrogate)?', 'Stimulus that acquires MO effectiveness by being paired with another MO. Example: seeing empty gas gauge (paired with deprivation of transportation).']

// BEHAVIOR CHANGE PROCEDURES (100 flashcards)

  ['extinction', 'What is escape extinction?', 'Preventing escape/avoidance from terminating aversive stimulus. Task demand continues despite problem behavior. Example: guided compliance, physical prompting through task.'],
  ['extinction', 'What is attention extinction?', 'Withholding attention following attention-maintained behavior. Planned ignoring. Must be complete - partial attention strengthens behavior via intermittent reinforcement.'],
  ['antecedent', 'What is antecedent manipulation?', 'Modifying environmental events that occur before behavior to prevent problem behavior or promote desired behavior. Preventative approach.'],
  ['antecedent', 'What is noncontingent reinforcement (NCR)?', 'Delivering reinforcers on time-based schedule independent of behavior. Reduces motivation for problem behavior by providing "free" access to maintaining reinforcer.'],
  ['antecedent', 'What is high-probability request sequence?', 'Presenting several easy tasks (high-p) that learner typically complies with, then presenting difficult task (low-p). Behavioral momentum increases compliance.'],
  ['antecedent', 'What is choice offering?', 'Providing options to increase sense of control. Can reduce problem behavior maintained by escape/attention. Example: "Do you want to do math or reading first?"'],
  ['antecedent', 'What is activity schedule?', 'Visual depiction of sequence of activities/tasks. Promotes independence by showing what to do and when. Reduces transition problems and increases predictability.'],
  ['token-economy', 'What is a token economy?', 'System where conditioned reinforcers (tokens) are earned for target behaviors and later exchanged for backup reinforcers.'],
  ['token-economy', 'What is response cost in token economy?', 'Losing tokens contingent on problem behavior. Form of negative punishment within the token system.'],
  ['token-economy', 'What is a token?', 'A conditioned reinforcer exchangeable for backup reinforcers. Must be durable, portable, easily dispensed, not easily counterfeited.'],
  ['token-economy', 'What are backup reinforcers?', 'The actual reinforcers that tokens can be exchanged for. Must be varied and individualized to maintain token value.'],
  ['contingency', 'What is contingency contracting?', 'Written agreement specifying behavioral objectives and consequences. States who will do what, when, and what they will receive. All parties sign.'],
  ['contingency', 'What are essential components of a behavior contract?', '1) Clear description of target behavior, 2) When/where it should occur, 3) What reinforcement will be earned, 4) Delivery schedule, 5) Signatures of all parties.'],
  ['self-management', 'What is self-monitoring?', 'Observing and recording one\'s own behavior. First step in self-management. Recording itself can reactively change behavior.']
