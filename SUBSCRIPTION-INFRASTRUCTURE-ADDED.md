- ✅ Everything works exactly as before

**Users will not notice any changes.**

2. Edit `config.js` → change `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED: false` to `true`

4. Deploy

**Time required**: 2-4 hours

### **Recommended Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2**: Keep free (build user base) ← **YOU ARE HERE**

## 🎯 Files Added/Modified

### **New Files:**
```
config.js                           - Feature flags & configuration
subscription.js                     - Subscription logic
billing.html                        - Billing management page
STRIPE-SETUP-GUIDE.md              - Complete activation guide
SUBSCRIPTION-INFRASTRUCTURE-ADDED.md - This file
```

### **Modified Files:**
```
.gitignore                         - Added Stripe key protection

### **Files NOT Modified:**

## 🧪 How It Works

### **Feature Flag System:**
```javascript
if (CONFIG.SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED) {
  // Show subscription UI
  // Check subscription status
  // Gate premium features
} else {
  // Everyone gets full access (current state)
}
```

### **Smart Pricing:**
```javascript
User created before Dec 31, 2025:
  → $15/month (Early Adopter)
  
User created after Dec 31, 2025:
  → $30/month (Regular)
```

### **Access Control:**
```javascript
if (user has subscription OR subscriptions disabled) {
  → Full access to everything
} else if (guest mode) {
  → Limited access (50 questions, 100 flashcards, 10 scenarios)
} else {
  → Show "Subscribe" prompt
}
```
