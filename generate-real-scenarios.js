    scenario: 'A BCBA observes that a 7-year-old client with autism engages in hand-flapping at high rates during academic tasks. ABC data collected over 2 weeks shows hand-flapping occurs primarily when difficult math problems are presented (18-22 instances per session). When the BCBA removes the worksheet, hand-flapping immediately stops. During preferred activities like playing with blocks, hand-flapping occurs 0-2 times per session.',
    question: 'Based on this data, what function is the hand-flapping most likely serving?',
    options: [
      'Automatic reinforcement (sensory stimulation)',
      'Escape from aversive academic demands',
      'Access to attention from teacher',
      'Access to tangible items (preferred toys)'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'The data indicates a clear escape function. Key indicators: (1) Behavior occurs at high rates during demands (18-22 per session), (2) Behavior stops immediately when demands are removed, (3) Behavior is low during preferred activities (0-2 per session). This pattern is characteristic of behavior maintained by negative reinforcement (escape from aversive stimuli). Automatic reinforcement (option A) would occur at similar rates across all conditions. Attention function (option C) would show increase when attention is provided. Tangible function (option D) would show increase when items are present but unavailable.',

    scenario: 'During a functional analysis, a 5-year-old client\'s hitting behavior shows the following rates across conditions: Attention condition = 12 hits/10 min, Escape condition = 2 hits/10 min, Tangible condition = 1 hit/10 min, Alone condition = 0 hits/10 min, Play condition = 1 hit/10 min. The behavior analyst conducts a second functional analysis 2 weeks later and obtains nearly identical results.',
    question: 'What is the most appropriate conclusion based on these functional analysis results?',
    options: [
      'The hitting is maintained by automatic reinforcement because it occurs in the alone condition',
      'The hitting is maintained by access to attention because rates are highest in the attention condition',
      'The hitting serves multiple functions and requires a combined intervention approach',
      'The results are inconclusive and a third functional analysis should be conducted'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'The data clearly shows an attention function. The hitting occurs at substantially higher rates in the attention condition (12 hits/10 min) compared to all other conditions (0-2 hits/10 min). The replication of results across two functional analyses strengthens this conclusion, demonstrating experimental control and reliability. Option A is incorrect because behavior doesn\'t occur in alone condition. Option C is incorrect because there\'s no evidence of multiple functions - one function is clearly dominant. Option D is incorrect because the results are clear and replicated. A well-differentiated functional analysis with replicated results provides strong evidence for function-based treatment.',

    scenario: 'A teacher reports that a student screams during transitions between activities. The BCBA conducts observations and notes: Transition to preferred activity (recess) = 0 screams, Transition from preferred to non-preferred activity (recess to math) = 8 screams average, Transition between neutral activities (science to reading) = 2 screams average. Screaming typically results in a 2-3 minute delay in the transition.',
    question: 'What is the most likely function of the screaming behavior?',
    options: [
      'Access to preferred activities (positive reinforcement)',
      'Escape or avoidance of non-preferred activities (negative reinforcement)',
      'Sensory stimulation (automatic reinforcement)',
      'Access to peer attention during transitions'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'The pattern strongly suggests escape/avoidance function. Evidence: (1) Screaming is highest when transitioning FROM preferred TO non-preferred activities (8 screams), (2) No screaming when going TO preferred activities, (3) Moderate screaming during neutral transitions, (4) Screaming produces a functional outcome - delay in the transition. This is classic negative reinforcement where the behavior postpones or avoids an aversive event. Option A is incorrect because behavior doesn\'t increase when preferred activities are available. Option C is incorrect because rates vary by condition (not constant as in automatic reinforcement). Option D lacks evidence of peer attention contingency.',

    scenario: 'A functional assessment reveals that a client\'s aggressive behavior (hitting, kicking) is maintained by escape from academic tasks. The behavior occurs 15-20 times per hour during demanding activities. The BCBA wants to implement a function-based intervention.',
    question: 'Which intervention would be most appropriate as the PRIMARY component of a function-based treatment?',
    options: [
      'Response cost: Remove tokens for each instance of aggression',
      'Time-out: Remove client from classroom for 5 minutes after aggression',
      'Functional Communication Training: Teach client to request breaks appropriately',
      'Differential reinforcement: Provide edibles for periods without aggression'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'FCT (Functional Communication Training) is the most appropriate primary intervention for escape-maintained behavior. It directly addresses the function by teaching an appropriate alternative behavior (requesting breaks) that serves the same function as the problem behavior. This is the gold standard for function-based treatment. Options A and B (response cost and time-out) are punishment procedures that don\'t teach alternative skills and may worsen escape-maintained behavior. Option D (DRO with edibles) doesn\'t match the behavioral function - if behavior is escape-maintained, providing edibles won\'t be as effective as providing the actual functional reinforcer (breaks). Best practice is FCT combined with extinction for problem behavior.',

    scenario: 'A client successfully completed FCT training and now appropriately requests breaks instead of engaging in problem behavior. However, the client is requesting breaks 20-30 times per hour, which is interfering with learning. Initial FCT was on a continuous reinforcement schedule (every request honored).',
    question: 'What is the most appropriate next step in the FCT intervention?',
    options: [
      'Discontinue FCT and return to baseline because it is not working effectively',
      'Implement extinction for break requests to reduce the frequency',
      'Gradually thin the reinforcement schedule using increasing fixed ratio requirements',
      'Add punishment for excessive break requests to decrease frequency'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'Schedule thinning is the standard next step in FCT protocols. After establishing the communication response on CRF (continuous reinforcement), the schedule must be systematically thinned to practical levels. This is done gradually (FR-1 ‚Üí FR-2 ‚Üí FR-3 ‚Üí FR-5, etc.) to maintain the communicative response while reducing frequency to acceptable levels. Option A is incorrect - FCT is working (problem behavior reduced), it just needs refinement. Option B (extinction) would eliminate the newly learned skill. Option D (punishment) is contraindicated - adding punishment to a replacement behavior that\'s serving the same function could cause resurgence of problem behavior. Schedule thinning is an essential component of comprehensive FCT treatment.',

    scenario: 'A behavior intervention plan includes differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA). The target is to decrease screaming (current rate: 25/hour) and increase appropriate hand-raising (current rate: 2/hour). The function of screaming is to access teacher attention.',
    question: 'How should the BCBA implement the DRA procedure?',
    options: [
      'Provide attention for hand-raising only, withhold attention for screaming',
      'Provide attention for screaming to build rapport, then gradually shift to hand-raising',
      'Provide attention when screaming does NOT occur (DRO procedure)',
      'Provide attention for both behaviors initially, then fade attention for screaming'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative behavior) requires providing reinforcement for the alternative behavior while withholding reinforcement (extinction) for the problem behavior. Since both behaviors serve the same function (accessing attention), attention should be provided contingent on hand-raising and withheld for screaming. This creates a differential that favors the appropriate behavior. Option B is incorrect - reinforcing problem behavior is contraindicated in DRA. Option C describes DRO (different procedure), not DRA. Option D would initially strengthen both behaviors, making problem behavior more resistant to extinction. The key to DRA effectiveness is the clear differential: alternative behavior produces reinforcement, problem behavior does not.',
