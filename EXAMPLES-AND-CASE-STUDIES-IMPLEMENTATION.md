**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Version**: 7.0.0  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ GOAL

Add **200+ real-world examples** and **50+ case studies** to increase standalone pass rate from **90-95%** to **95-98%** (without textbook).

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: COMPLETE (18 Examples + 5 Case Studies)

### What Was Added:

**Real-World Examples (18)**:
- Reinforcement examples (positive & negative)
- Punishment examples (Type I & II)
- Extinction examples
- Stimulus control examples

**Case Studies (5)**:
1. **CS001**: Reducing Aggression Through FCT
2. **CS002**: Implementing Classroom Token Economy
3. **CS003**: Rapid Toilet Training Protocol
4. **CS004**: Teaching Greetings via Video Modeling
5. **CS005**: Reducing Hand Flapping with DRO

### Example Structure:
```javascript
{
  topicId: 'foundations-2',
  category: 'reinforcement',
  title: 'Classroom Participation',
  scenario: 'Teacher notices student rarely raises hand in class.',
  intervention: 'Teacher praises student immediately each time they raise their hand.',
  result: 'Student begins raising hand 5-7 times per class (up from 0-1 times).',
  principle: 'Positive reinforcement - praise added after hand-raising, behavior increased'
}
```

### Case Study Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: 'cs001',
  title: 'Reducing Aggression Through FCT',
  category: 'aggression',
  relatedTopics: ['fct-1', 'functional-assessment-1', 'differential-reinforcement-1'],
  scenario: { client, setting, problemBehavior, impact },
  assessment: { method, findings, dataPatterns, hypothesis },
  intervention: { approach, components, training, implementation },
  results: { timeline, behaviorChange, percentReduction, maintenanceData, socialValidation },
  keyConcepts: [...],
  examTopics: '...',
  lessonLearned: '...'
