    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: design === 'multiple baseline' ? 
      `This is a multiple baseline design across participants. It demonstrates experimental control by showing that behavior changes only when and only for the participant(s) receiving intervention, while participants still in baseline remain stable. The staggered introduction of intervention at different time points rules out confounding variables like maturation, history, or testing effects. If an external factor caused change, all participants would improve simultaneously. The systematic relationship between intervention introduction and behavior change for each participant demonstrates the intervention is responsible for the behavior change (internal validity). This design is particularly useful when reversal designs are not ethical or practical.` :
      design === 'reversal (ABAB)' ?
      `This is a reversal or withdrawal design (ABAB). It demonstrates experimental control and a functional relationship by showing behavior systematically changes when the intervention is introduced and withdrawn repeatedly. The pattern (baseline → intervention → withdrawal → reintroduction) shows that behavior is controlled by the intervention, not extraneous variables. The return to baseline during withdrawal demonstrates that improvement was due to the intervention, not maturation or other factors. Replication of the effect (behavior improving twice when intervention introduced) strengthens confidence. This design is the gold standard for demonstrating functional relationships but requires that withdrawal is ethical and practical.` :
      design === 'alternating treatments' ?
      `This is an alternating treatments design (also called multi-element design or simultaneous treatment design). It allows comparison of two or more interventions by rapidly alternating between them, often within the same session. Discriminative stimuli signal which treatment is in effect to prevent multiple treatment interference. The design quickly identifies the more effective treatment. Data differentiation between conditions demonstrates differential effectiveness. This design is efficient for treatment comparison but requires that treatments can be rapidly alternated and clearly discriminated.` :
      design === 'changing criterion' ?
      `This is a changing criterion design. Experimental control is demonstrated when behavior systematically matches each new criterion as it's introduced. If behavior closely tracks criterion changes (rather than changing gradually or remaining at one level), it shows the criterion itself controls behavior, not other variables. This design is useful for behaviors that should be gradually shaped or increased/decreased in a stepwise fashion. It doesn't require reversal or multiple baselines but requires systematic criterion changes and corresponding behavior changes.` :
      `This is a multiple probe design, a variation of multiple baseline that uses intermittent baseline probes rather than continuous baseline measurement. This reduces assessment burden while still demonstrating experimental control. Teaching is introduced sequentially across skills/behaviors. Each shows acquisition only when teaching begins, demonstrating the intervention (not maturation or practice effects from probing) causes learning. More efficient than continuous baseline when frequent measurement is burdensome or could lead to reactive effects.`,
