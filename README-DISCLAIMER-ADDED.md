## 📖 Exam Success Disclaimer

**Your exam success depends on your dedication to studying the material.** 
ABA Mastery provides comprehensive, research-backed tools and content 
covering 100% of the BACB Task List. However, passing the BCBA or BCaBA 
exam requires:

- ✅ Consistent study habits - Regular practice over time
- ✅ Active engagement - Using all features (practice questions, flashcards, case studies)
- ✅ Conceptual understanding - Not just memorization
- ✅ Clinical application - Connecting theory to real-world scenarios
- ✅ Self-assessment - Tracking progress and addressing weak areas

**This app is a powerful study tool, but your commitment to thorough 
preparation is essential for exam success.** We provide the resources; 
you bring the dedication.
