## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If notification doesn't appear:**
1. Hard refresh: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+F5** (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in incognito/private mode
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### **If redirect doesn't happen:**
1. Wait the full 1.5 seconds
2. Check if notification appeared first
3. Look for JavaScript errors in console (F12)
4. Try a different browser
5. Check internet connection

### **If you see an old-style alert popup:**
Your browser has cached the old version:
1. Hard refresh: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+F5** (Windows)
2. Clear cache completely
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Try incognito/private mode

---

## 💻 **Browser Console Check:**

### **Open Browser Console (F12 → Console):**

**Expected console messages:**
```javascript
✅ User logged in: test123@aba.com
// ... other messages ...
// (when you click Sign Out)
🚪 Sign out initiated (if logged)
Firebase sign out successful (if logged)
Local data cleared (if logged)
// (redirect happens automatically)
```

**No red errors should appear!**
