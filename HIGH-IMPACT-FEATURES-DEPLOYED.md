## 💪 FEATURES IN ACTION

### **Spaced Repetition Example:**

**Traditional Approach:**
- Day 1: Learn 50 questions
- Day 7: Review same 50 questions
- Day 14: Review same 50 again
- Retention: 60-70%

**Spaced Repetition (Your App):**
- Day 1: Learn 20 new questions
- Day 2: Review 5 from Day 1 (the hard ones)
- Day 3: Learn 20 new + review 3 from Day 1
- Day 4: Review 7 from Day 2, 5 from Day 1
- Day 8: Review 10 from Day 1 (perfect timing)
- **Retention: 85-90%**

**Result: Same 50 questions, 25% better retention with LESS total study time!**

---

### **Comparison Tables Example:**

**Without Tables:**
Student: "Wait, is negative reinforcement when you add or remove something? And does behavior increase or decrease?"
*Flips through notes, gets confused*
Result: 50% chance of guessing wrong

**With Tables (Your App):**
Student sees 2×2 matrix:
```
        ADD     |  REMOVE
────────────────┼──────────
INCREASE  Pos.R | Neg.R  ✓
DECREASE  Pos.P | Neg.P
```
"Negative reinforcement = REMOVE + INCREASE!"
Result: Instant clarity, 95% accuracy

---

### **Test Strategies Example:**

**Without Strategies:**
Question: "All of the following are true EXCEPT..."
Student: Reads too fast, misses "EXCEPT"
Chooses correct answer (but question asked for WRONG one)
Result: Incorrect

**With Strategies (Your App):**
Strategy hint: "⚠️ 'EXCEPT' question - Looking for FALSE option!"
Student: Circles "EXCEPT", marks each as T/F, finds false one
Result: Correct!

**This happens 10-15 times per exam = 5-8% score improvement!**

---
