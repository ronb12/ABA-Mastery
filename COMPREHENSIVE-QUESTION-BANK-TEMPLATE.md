#### Sample Question Format:
```json
{
  "id": "qXXX",
  "category": "intervention",
  "section": "G",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "question": "A BCBA is implementing DRA to reduce screaming. The student currently screams 30 times/hour. Which alternative behavior would be MOST appropriate to reinforce?",
  "options": [
    "Any behavior except screaming",
    "Raising hand appropriately to gain attention",
    "Remaining quiet for 10-minute intervals",
    "Speaking in a whisper"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative behavior) should reinforce a SPECIFIC, FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT alternative that's appropriate. If screaming = attention, teach appropriate attention-seeking (hand-raising). Option A is DRO (any other behavior). Option C is DRO with intervals. Option D might not serve same function. The alternative must be socially acceptable AND produce same reinforcer as problem behavior.",
  "reference": "Cooper et al. (2020), Chapter 21; BACB Task List G-14"

  "question": "During extinction of a behavior previously maintained on VR-20, you would expect:",
  "options": [
    "Immediate cessation of behavior",
    "Greater resistance to extinction than continuous reinforcement",
    "Faster extinction than if on FR-20",
    "No extinction burst"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The PARTIAL REINFORCEMENT EFFECT predicts behaviors maintained on intermittent schedules (like VR-20) show GREATER RESISTANCE to extinction than those on continuous reinforcement. Reason: Intermittent reinforcement is already unpredictable - the change to extinction is less discriminable. The organism has learned 'keep trying, it will eventually work.' Variable schedules produce more resistance than fixed schedules. Extinction bursts are still expected.",
  "reference": "Cooper et al. (2020), Chapter 8; BACB Task List B-6"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Ethics Code 1.06(d) addresses gifts. Behavior analysts should DECLINE gifts that could create conflicts of interest or impair objectivity. Expensive gifts are inappropriate as they create obligations and could affect professional judgment. Politely decline and explain the ethical boundary. Small, inexpensive gifts (handmade card, baked goods) may be acceptable depending on cultural context, but expensive/valuable gifts should always be declined. Documentation doesn't make inappropriate gifts appropriate.",
