# 👤 Personalization System - Complete Guide

## ✨ **OVERVIEW**

---

### **10. Ratings (Optional)** ⭐
**Location:** When submitting app ratings

**Note:** Ratings **include** user email but **don't display** the name publicly. Name is used for:
- Internal tracking (which users rated)
- Potential follow-up thank you messages
- Analytics

---

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **How Name is Loaded:**
```javascript
// Automatically loads when user signs in
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    if (user) {
        userName = user.displayName; // "Sarah Johnson"
        firstName = userName.split(' ')[0]; // "Sarah"
    }
});
```

### **Usage in Your Code:**
```javascript
// Get personalized greeting
const greeting = personalization.getTimeBasedGreeting();
// Returns: { greeting: "Good morning, Sarah!", emoji: "☀️" }

// Get congratulations message
const congrats = personalization.getCongratulationsMessage('quiz');
// Returns: "🎉 Congratulations, Sarah!"

// Get encouragement message
const encourage = personalization.getEncouragementMessage();
// Returns: "Keep going, Sarah! You're learning! 💪"

// Get exam result message
const result = personalization.getExamResultMessage(true, 85);
// Returns: { title: "🎓 Incredible, Sarah! You passed!", message: "..." }

// Check if user has name
if (personalization.hasName()) {
    // Use personalized messages
}
```

---

## 💡 **SMART FALLBACKS**

**If NO name provided:**
- "Good morning!" (instead of "Good morning, Sarah!")
- "🎉 Congratulations!" (instead of "🎉 Congratulations, Sarah!")
- All messages still work, just without personalization

**This ensures:**
- App works for all users
- No errors if name missing
- Graceful degradation
