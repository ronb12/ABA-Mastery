## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://aba-mastery-app.web.app
2. **Hold down**: Cmd + Shift
3. **Press**: R
4. Wait for page to fully reload
5. Go to Settings â†’ Test-Taking Strategy Training
6. Click "Learn More" â†’ **Should work now!** âœ¨

### Method 2: Clear Cache in DevTools

1. Go to: https://aba-mastery-app.web.app
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd + Option + I)
3. **Right-click** the refresh button in browser
4. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
5. Test the buttons

### Method 3: Incognito Window

2. Go to: https://aba-mastery-app.web.app
3. Go to Settings
4. Click "Learn More" â†’ **Will work!**

## How to Verify It's Working

After hard refresh, check in DevTools Console:

1. Press **F12** (DevTools)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Reload page
4. Look for: `test-taking-strategies.js?v=1.0.1`
5. Should show **v=1.0.1** (new version) not v=1.0.0

---

## What Changed

### Files Deployed:

1. **test-taking-strategies.js** - Fixed button event handlers
2. **app.html** - Updated version to v=1.0.1 (cache bust)

### The Fix:

```javascript
// Before (not working):
onclick="showStrategyDetails('...')"

// After (working):
onclick="testTakingStrategies.showStrategyDetails('...'); event.stopPropagation();"
```

This ensures:
- âœ… Button calls the correct function
- âœ… Event doesn't bubble up to parent elements
- âœ… Modal opens properly

---

## Test Results

Automated test confirmed:

```
âœ… Found 5 "Learn More" buttons
âœ… All 5 are visible
âœ… Click opens modal
âœ… Modal has title, content, and close button
âœ… Close button works
```
