## 📝 **WHAT MAKES THEM REALISTIC:**

### **Every Scenario Includes:**
- ✅ Specific client ages (3-35 years)
- ✅ Actual diagnoses (autism, DD, ADHD, etc.)
- ✅ Real settings (classroom, clinic, home, residential)
- ✅ Behavior data (rates like "17 times per session")
- ✅ Clinical contexts BCBAs encounter
- ✅ Professional terminology
- ✅ Exam-relevant situations

### **Example Realistic Scenario:**
```
A BCBA is working with a 22-year-old client with autism in a 
residential facility. The client engages in biting behavior primarily 
during math instruction. ABC data collected over 1 weeks shows biting 
occurs an average of 17 times per session during academic demands. 
When the task is removed, the behavior immediately stops. During 
preferred activities, biting occurs only 2 times per session.

Question: Based on this data pattern, what function is the biting 
behavior most likely serving?

[User must answer, then sees explanation]
```

**This IS what BCBAs encounter in practice!** ✅
