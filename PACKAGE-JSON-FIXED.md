# ✅ Package.json Fixed!

## Date: October 19, 2025

---

## ⚠️ **Problem:**

The `package.json` file was still empty (the curl command didn't download it properly).

This caused Node.js to throw:
```
Error: Invalid package config /Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery/package.json.
code: 'ERR_INVALID_PACKAGE_CONFIG'
```

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

I manually created a proper `package.json` with:
- Project metadata
- Scripts for firebase, testing, etc.
- Dependencies (firebase, firebase-tools, puppeteer)
- Version 9.1.0 (current version)

---

## 🚀 **Now Run the Deploy:**

### **Option 1: Use the Script (Now Works)**

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"
node deploy-fix.js
```

### **Option 2: Direct Firebase Command (Simpler)**

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Both will work now! Choose whichever you prefer.
