## ✅ FORMATTING ENHANCEMENT IMPACT

### **What Changed:**

**JavaScript Enhancement (app.js):**
```javascript
// Detects section headers (ALL CAPS:) and makes them bold
const formattedContent = topic.content
    .split('\n\n')  // Split into paragraphs
    .map(para => {
        // Make headers bold
        const headerMatch = para.match(/^([A-Z\s&,'()]+:)/);
        if (headerMatch) {
            const header = headerMatch[1];
            const rest = para.substring(header.length);
            return `<p><strong class="section-header">${header}</strong>${rest.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')}</p>`;
        }
        return `<p>${para.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')}</p>`;
    })
    .join('');
```

**CSS Enhancement:**
```css
.topic-full-content p {
    margin-bottom: 1.5em;      /* Space between paragraphs */
    line-height: 1.7;          /* Better readability */
}

.section-header {
    display: block;
    color: var(--primary);      /* Colored headers */
    font-size: 1.1em;          /* Slightly larger */
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
    letter-spacing: 0.5px;
}
