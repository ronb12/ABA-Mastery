  // BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLES (100 flashcards)
  behavioralPrinciples: [
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is automatic reinforcement?', a: 'Reinforcement that occurs independent of social mediation. The behavior itself produces the reinforcing consequence. Example: scratching an itch, rocking for sensory input.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is a conditioned reinforcer?', a: 'A previously neutral stimulus that has acquired reinforcing properties through pairing with other reinforcers. Also called secondary or learned reinforcer. Example: money, praise, tokens.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is an unconditioned reinforcer?', a: 'A stimulus that functions as reinforcement without prior learning or conditioning. Also called primary reinforcer. Examples: food, water, warmth, sexual stimulation.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'Define generalized conditioned reinforcer', a: 'A conditioned reinforcer that has been paired with many other reinforcers and is therefore effective across many conditions. Examples: money, attention, approval.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is the Premack Principle?', a: 'High-probability behaviors can reinforce low-probability behaviors. \'First/then\' contingencies: \'First do homework (low-p), then play video games (high-p).\'' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is deprivation?', a: 'A motivating operation that increases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and evokes behavior that has produced that stimulus. Example: food deprivation increases eating.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is satiation?', a: 'A motivating operation that decreases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and abates behavior that has produced that stimulus. Example: eating to fullness.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is response-reinforcer dependency?', a: 'The contingency relationship where reinforcement depends on specific response. Essential for learning - reinforcement must be contingent on behavior.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is contiguity?', a: 'Temporal proximity between response and consequence. Shorter delays produce stronger learning. Immediate reinforcement most effective.' },
    { cat: 'reinforcement', q: 'What is the matching law?', a: 'Organisms allocate behavior to alternatives in same proportion as reinforcement allocated to those alternatives. Describes choice behavior mathematically.' },
    { cat: 'punishment', q: 'What are negative side effects of punishment?', a: 'Emotional responses, escape/avoidance, aggression toward punisher or others, modeling of punitive behavior, only suppresses behavior without teaching alternatives.' },
    { cat: 'punishment', q: 'What is overcorrection?', a: 'Punishment requiring restoration plus additional improvement (restitutional) or repeated practice of correct behavior (positive practice). Example: clean up mess plus clean whole room.' },
    { cat: 'punishment', q: 'What is time-out?', a: 'Time-out from positive reinforcement - removing access to reinforcement for specified period contingent on problem behavior. Types: exclusion or non-exclusion.' },
    { cat: 'punishment', q: 'What is response cost?', a: 'Removal of specified amount of reinforcer contingent on behavior. Type of negative punishment. Examples: losing tokens, fines, privilege removal.' },
    { cat: 'punishment', q: 'When is punishment ethically appropriate?', a: 'When: 1) Reinforcement-based procedures tried first, 2) Behavior is dangerous, 3) Potential benefits outweigh risks, 4) Informed consent obtained, 5) Proper oversight in place.' },
    { cat: 'extinction', q: 'What is extinction burst?', a: 'Temporary increase in frequency, duration, or intensity of behavior when extinction begins. Expected part of extinction process.' },
    { cat: 'extinction', q: 'What is spontaneous recovery?', a: 'Reappearance of extinguished behavior after passage of time without intervention. Typically weaker than original behavior and extinguishes more quickly.' },
    { cat: 'extinction', q: 'What is extinction-induced aggression?', a: 'Aggressive behavior that emerges during extinction process. Side effect of removing reinforcement - organism may attack available targets.' },
    { cat: 'extinction', q: 'What is resistance to extinction?', a: 'How long behavior persists once reinforcement is withheld. Influenced by reinforcement history, schedule, magnitude of reinforcement.' },
    { cat: 'extinction', q: 'What is sensory extinction?', a: 'Removing or blocking automatic reinforcement maintaining behavior. Example: protective equipment prevents self-injury from producing sensory input.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is a discriminative stimulus (SD)?', a: 'Antecedent stimulus signaling that reinforcement is available for specific behavior. Sets the occasion for behavior to occur.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is S-delta?', a: 'Stimulus signaling that reinforcement is NOT available. Behavior occurs less frequently or not at all in presence of S-delta.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is stimulus discrimination training?', a: 'Reinforcing response in presence of one stimulus (SD) and withholding reinforcement in presence of another (S-delta). Teaches differential responding.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is concept formation?', a: 'Discriminating all instances from all non-instances of a stimulus class. Requires positive examples and non-examples.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is stimulus generalization?', a: 'When behavior occurs in presence of stimuli similar to SD even though those stimuli weren\'t present during training. Example: trained with red ball, responds to pink ball.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is a generalization gradient?', a: 'Graphic display showing degree of stimulus generalization. Responses plotted against stimulus similarity. Steeper gradient = less generalization.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is errorless learning?', a: 'Teaching procedure that prevents errors by using controlling prompts initially, then fading them. Minimizes frustration and prevents error learning.' },
    { cat: 'stimulus-control', q: 'What is stimulus equivalence?', a: 'Derived stimulus relations where stimuli become functionally interchangeable. Requires reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Foundation for symbolic language.' },
    { cat: 'motivation', q: 'What is a motivating operation (MO)?', a: 'Environmental variable that alters reinforcing/punishing effectiveness of stimulus AND alters frequency of behavior that has produced that stimulus. Two effects: value-altering and behavior-altering.' },
    { cat: 'motivation', q: 'What is an establishing operation (EO)?', a: 'MO that INCREASES reinforcing effectiveness and EVOKES behavior that has produced that reinforcer. Example: food deprivation establishes food value and evokes eating.' }

    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is an intraverbal?', a: 'Verbal operant controlled by verbal discriminative stimulus WITHOUT point-to-point correspondence. Conversational speech, answering questions. Example: "What color?" → "Red".' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is formal similarity?', a: 'When antecedent stimulus and response product share same mode. Required for echoic (both vocal) but not for other verbal operants.' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is point-to-point correspondence?', a: 'When parts of verbal stimulus match parts of response in sequence. Required for echoic, copying text, imitation.' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is an autoclitic?', a: 'Verbal behavior about verbal behavior. Modifies function of other verbal operants. Includes grammar, negation, quantification. Example: "I think...", "maybe...", "not..."' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is transfer of stimulus control in VB?', a: 'Shifting control from one antecedent to another. Example: echoic-to-tact transfer (hear "ball" to see ball), mand-to-tact transfer.' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is multiple control in VB?', a: 'Single verbal response simultaneously controlled by two or more variables. Makes response more probable and more precise. Example: "water" controlled by seeing water AND being thirsty.' },
    { cat: 'verbal-behavior', q: 'What is convergent multiple control?', a: 'Multiple variables controlling same verbal response. Strengthens that specific response. Example: see cookie + hungry + someone asks "what do you want?" all evoke "cookie".' }
