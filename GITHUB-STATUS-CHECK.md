- **Date**: October 19, 2025 (earlier today)
- **Files Modified**: 123 files

---

## ✅ **How to Verify:**

### **Option 1: Browser (Easiest)**
1. Click this link: https://github.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery/commits/main
2. You should see `5ca559f` as the most recent commit
3. Check the timestamp (should be within the last hour)

### **Option 2: Check landing.html**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery/blob/main/landing.html
2. Look for "See All Features" button code (around line 507)
3. Look for features modal code (around line 547-685)

### **Option 3: Terminal**
If you want to verify locally:

```bash
cd "/Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/ABA Mastery"
git log --oneline -5
```

This will show the last 5 commits. You should see:
```
5ca559f Add features modal to landing page - 14 features showcase with beautiful UI
fcabd73 Fix: Update README, PWA features, rating system, personalization
...
```

---

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **In landing.html on GitHub:**
- Search for: `openFeaturesModal`
- Search for: `See All Features`
- Search for: `features-modal`
- Search for: `Complete Feature Set`

If you find these, the features modal code is there! ✅

---

## ⚠️ **If It's NOT There:**

This would mean the push failed or didn't complete. But we saw:
```
To https://github.com/ronb12/ABA-Mastery.git
   fcabd73..5ca559f  main -> main
✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub main!
```

So it SHOULD be there.

---

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

When you visit the commits page, you should see:

```
5ca559f - Add features modal to landing page - 14 features showcase... - 1 hour ago
fcabd73 - Fix: Update README, PWA features, rating system... - 7 hours ago
e68a535 - [Previous commit] - [Date]
...
```

---

## 📱 **Quick Test:**

Just visit: **https://aba-mastery-app.web.app**

If the features modal is working on the live site (which it should be since deployment completed), then it's definitely on GitHub too!
