  { id: 'fc76', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is an FI scallop?', answer: 'Response pattern in Fixed Interval schedules where rate is low after reinforcement and accelerates as interval ends. Creates characteristic upward curve on cumulative record.' },
  { id: 'fc77', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is ratio strain?', answer: 'Disruption in responding when ratio requirement increases too rapidly. Can lead to extinction-like pausing or behavior cessation.' },
  { id: 'fc78', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a limited hold?', answer: 'Restriction on time available for reinforcement after requirement is met. If response doesn\'t occur within time limit, reinforcement is withheld. Example: FI-30s LH5s.' },
  { id: 'fc79', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a compound schedule?', answer: 'Two or more schedules in effect for same behavior. Types: concurrent, multiple, chained, tandem, mixed.' },
  { id: 'fc80', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a concurrent schedule?', answer: 'Two or more schedules available simultaneously for different behaviors. Person can respond on either schedule. Studies choice and preference.' },
  { id: 'fc81', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a multiple schedule?', answer: 'Two or more schedules presented sequentially, each with distinctive SD. Behavior in presence of each SD produces that schedule\'s reinforcement.' },
  { id: 'fc82', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a chained schedule?', answer: 'Sequence of schedules, each with its own SD. Completion of one schedule produces SD for next. Only final schedule produces primary reinforcement.' },
  { id: 'fc83', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a mixed schedule?', answer: 'Two or more schedules presented sequentially WITHOUT discriminative stimuli. Same as multiple schedule but no signals which schedule is active.' },
  { id: 'fc84', category: 'schedules', question: 'What is a tandem schedule?', answer: 'Sequence of schedules like chained, but no discriminative stimuli. Must complete all schedule requirements before reinforcement.' },
  { id: 'fc85', category: 'reinforcement', question: 'What is the matching law formula?', answer: 'B1/(B1+B2) = R1/(R1+R2). Proportion of responding on alternative 1 matches proportion of reinforcement from alternative 1.' },
  { id: 'fc86', category: 'reinforcement', question: 'What is undermatching?', answer: 'Less sensitivity to reinforcement differences than matching law predicts. Responding less differentiated than reinforcement rates.' },
  { id: 'fc87', category: 'reinforcement', question: 'What is overmatching?', answer: 'Greater sensitivity to reinforcement differences than matching law predicts. Responding more differentiated than reinforcement rates.' },
  { id: 'fc88', category: 'reinforcement', question: 'What is bias in matching law?', answer: 'Preference for one alternative independent of reinforcement rates. Can result from response effort differences, quality differences, or inherent preference.' },
  { id: 'fc89', category: 'reinforcement', question: 'What is concurrent-chains procedure?', answer: 'Method for studying conditioned reinforcement. Initial links (concurrent) lead to terminal links (chains). Choice in initial link reveals value of terminal link conditioned reinforcers.' }
