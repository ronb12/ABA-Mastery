# ✅ README Test Credentials Fixed

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Change**: Updated test credentials in README.md

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Old (Incorrect) Credentials:**
```
Email: sarah.johnson@abamastery.test
Password: Test123456!
```

### **New (Correct) Credentials:**
```
Email: test123@aba.com
Password: Test123!
```

**Also Added:**
```
Email: test456@aba.com
Password: Test456!
```

---

## 📝 **Why This Matters**

These are the actual test credentials used throughout the codebase:
- ✅ In `create-emulator-users.js`
- ✅ In all test scripts (`tests/*.js`)
- ✅ In test documentation
- ✅ In personalization tests

The old credentials (`sarah.johnson@abamastery.test`) don't exist and would confuse users trying to test the app.
